The number of consonants that are distinguished in English (about 24) is significantly larger than that of Hawaiian (around 8). For learners of either language, it may be easier to learn how to pronounce and distinguish 8 sounds as opposed to 24.%0a%0aThe Hawaiian consonants are as follows:%0a/m/, /n/, /p/, /k/, /ʔ/, /v/, /h/, and /l/.%0aIn orthography, they are represented as:%0a%3cm>, %3cn>, %3cp>, %3ck>, %3c'>, %3cw>, %3ch>, and %3cl>.%0aNote that there are no voiced plosives and no alveolar fricative. When words from English containing [b], [d], [g], [s], [z], and other consonants are borrowed into Hawaiian, they often change to account for the smaller vowel inventory of the language.%0aNote that the pair [k] and [t] are allophones in Hawaiian, as are [w] and [v] (possibly [ʋ], too), as well as /l/ and /ɾ/. Allophone pairs are pairs of sounds that represent the same phoneme. Native speakers might consider pairs the same sound. We noted an allophone of the /t/ phoneme in some dialects of English when we saw it realized as [ɾ] in the word "water."%0a%0aIn Hawaiian, [k] and [t] are used in free variation, but we consider /k/ to be the underlying phoneme because [k] appears more frequently. Dialectal variation may also play a role, since it has been observed that [t] appears more frequently in the northwestern islands, while [k] appears more towards the southeast.%0a%0aThis was an issue when developing orthography for the language, since missionaries were confused about whether to use %3ck> or %3ct>. They also were unsure about %3cd>, %3cr>, and %3cl>, as they all could represent the same sound.%0a%0aThe larger consonant inventory of English leads to loanwords in Hawaiian looking quite different. The group /t d θ ð s ʃ z ʒ tʃ dʒ k ɡ/ from English all maps to /k/. The Hawaiian word %3ckikiki>, for example, has two meanings, derived from "ticket" and "cheat."%0a%0aAn interesting note about the English consonant inventory is the presence of /θ/ and /ð/, the dental fricatives. These sounds are relatively uncommon among the world's languages. Spanish in Spain and Modern Greek both use dental fricatives as well. My mother (native speaker of Brazilian Portuguese) still finds these sounds very difficult to pronounce.%0a%0aParker Jones, however, notes a form of "lexical stratification," where words are separated into different groups that represent a change the language system to adjust for borrowings. While native words are part of the "core stratum," which maintains the original phonological system of the language, loan words form a part of the peripheral stratum, where some sounds from English (e.g. [b], [g], [s], [z]) are used and distinguished from each other. The word %3cpea>, for example, might be pronounced [pea] to mean "pear", [bea] to mean "bear", and [fea] to mean "fair". In the core stratum, however, these are all /pea/.%0a%0aDoes this form of "lexical stratification" for loan words exist in other languages? What about in other contexts?%0a%0aWhen non-native speakers of a language begin using different sounds for the same word, can this have an effect on the language itself? If this is the case, might we see a reduction in the size of English's phonological inventory?%0a%0aAs other languages continue gaining loan words from English, will their phonological systems change similarly?%0a%0aOf course, we can never be sure about how languages might change, as they are extremely complicated and rely on many speakers to modify how they convey meaning in order to change.%0a%0aThe differences between the consonant inventories of English and Hawaiian can offer us a view into how speakers of different languages approach unfamiliar sounds. While English uses some uncommon consonants, Hawaiian's smaller consonant inventory leads to interesting approaches to loan words and allophony.%0a%0aSources:%0aIan Maddieson. 2013.
