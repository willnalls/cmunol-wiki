You see, in your pale LIGHT eyes you have have never truly observed the incredible LIGHTing display this word puts on. So it is time to take you down from your LIGHT and airy ivory tower and LIGHT a fire beneath it. Now, I will tell you to LIGHTen up. All I'm doing is bringing to LIGHT what you already know.

Now, I know I may not be the LIGHT of your life, but at least you've now come to LIGHT.%0a%0aFrom my field research of the Nacireman language, I have discovered an incredible and exotic polysemy of the word "light". It is an incredibly flexible word, used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Also, it seasons many common phrases in the language. There is no doubt that this unique feature of the language contributes to the Nacireman worldview. Specifically, I deduce that this worldview places emphasis on fire since so many uses of the word relate to bright light either literally or figuratively. Interestingly, light is also used to describe things that are not heavy which may stem from the fact that fire itself is almost massless and leaves the fuel it burns lighter than it used to be. In sum, I conclude that Naciremans clearly have a unqiue way of thinking based on their copious use of "light".%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
