Though I have never lived on the reservation, I have visited many times, as my parents worked on the res as doctors for many years before I was born. Usage of Navajo has been decreasing steadily since the 1990's, resulting in it being designated as endangered by EGIDS. Part of this decline is due to the lack of available educators. Restrictive government policies have caused a shortage, both of teachers but also teaching resources, and as such, speaking rates of the Navajo language among Navajo have dropped from 94%25 in 1980 to just over 50%25 in 2010, with further decline anticipated (30%25 by 2020 census results). This decline is mainly in the youth (%3c=39 years old) of the Navajo, due to the aforementioned educational issues.%0a%0aThere are revitalization efforts, but they are severely hampered by Arizona's state government. Though operating semi-independently, Arizona passed a law in 2000 mandating that only English be used in immersion classes. The Navajo nation frequently holds summits to discuss and lead efforts towards revitalizing the language, with success. 97%25 of attendees said they were willing/wanted to learn the language when asked. However, the current barrier seems to be bridging into the online world. As I mentioned before, the greatest decline in speaking numbers has been shown in the younger generations. As there are very little actual learning resources available online (no doubt at least partly owing to the fact that Navajo is a unique language (not similar to basically any others, especially English), and is relatively complex as well), the younger generations struggle to stay engaged. Hopefully more online resources will be available in the future, helping to preserving the language.%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.lakepowelllife.com/a-language-revolution-on-the-navajo-nation/#:~:text=In%25201990%2520the%2520study%2520found,speakers%2520plummeted%2520to%252051%252Dpercent%0a%0ahttps://navajotimes.com/reznews/data-shows-huge-reduction-in-dine-speakers/%0a%0ahttps://ais.arizona.edu/thesis/revitalization-navajo-language-and-culture%0a%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/size-and-vitality/nav%0a%0ahttps://www.prweb.com/releases/cgtn_america_the_disappearing_language_of_navajo/prweb17973961.htm%0a%0ahttps://www.kuer.org/education/2021-08-13/members-of-navajo-nation-work-to-keep-their-language-dine-bizaad-alive%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-061808-473060#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Causatives by Juxtaposition in Navajo %0a-> - akshaychekuri%0a-> [-08.12.2022 - 22:18-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-061808-473060 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aWhile looking for a way to expand on this article, I happened upon an interesting paper regarding causatives in the Navajo language.
