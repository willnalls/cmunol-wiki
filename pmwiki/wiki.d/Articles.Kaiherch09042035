It is often used at the beginning of a statement, such as "Welp, I am failing this test." It is often surrounding an unfortunate circumstance, and sometimes substitutes the word 'well', adding the p at the end. The origin has been speculated to come from the 1994 film, Dumb and Dumber. A line in the movie is interpreted as "Welp, see you later", when in reality the actual word was well. (2) This was the start of the use of this word. %0a%0aAlthough it can be seen as slang, or the shortening of another word, 'welp' has become widely used, most extensively by the younger crowd. Classified as a real word by Merriam Webster(4), there is evidence that this word could make it into the OED. It has a clear meaning, describing the feeling of someone not sure what to do. It presents frustration or hopelessness within a sentence. Although data shows the word has not been extensively used for a long period of time (3), it can be argued that this is because it is used in more casual conversation. You would not use the term 'welp' in a standard google search, but it has been consistently more used online. Apps such as twitter, snapchat, and TikTok house the word as users describe their current states. Social media creates new slang used everyday, and 'welp' will continue to be used as an interjection just as it has the past 10 years. The clear meaning, widespread use and sustainability can all be reason to believe this word should be added to the OED.%0a%0aSources%0a1.https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Welp%0a2.https://slate.com/culture/2012/11/welp-slang-term-has-longer-history-than-you-might-think%0a3. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=welp&geo=US%0a4. https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/welp-meaning%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 220912-010621-351370#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Welp  %0a-> - kejackso%0a-> [-11.09.2022 - 18:06-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 220912-010621-351370 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a“Welp” is a slang that can be described in many different sounds but very few words express the meaning the same.

I do not believe that the majority of the slang invented should be placed in the OED, nor do I think it is likely to be added.

Despite “welp” being one of the only words to express that particular meaning, that does not mean there are no other ways to define that feeling.
