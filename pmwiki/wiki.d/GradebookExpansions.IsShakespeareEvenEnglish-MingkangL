As a non-native speaker of English, I found it almost impossible to understand the original text at first, and learning to read Shakespeare in high school was really like learning a new language for me. However, I would say it's still quite similar to modern English compared to Middle English (e.g. The Canterbury Tales) and Old English you mentioned. It doesn't have gender or cases any more, and the verb/noun conjugation has been simplified a lot. The Great Vowel Shift was also partially complete, making it sound more similar to modern-day English, so from these characteristics I think it can still be considered English. %0aI actually had the same question when I was learning classical Chinese in high school. Texts written over 2000 years ago (Confucius and Lao Tze's time) are impossible to decipher without numerous annotations and translation, while poems written over 1000 years ago are somewhat understandable with a few footnotes, while novels written 500 years ago are actually quite accessible, but they don't have a clear demarcation from each other. Perhaps this suggests that languages evolve very slowly, and there is not a clear line between "the old" and "the new," so the best thing we can do is to point to a rough period where the major changes took place.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000935-530310#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000935-530310#
