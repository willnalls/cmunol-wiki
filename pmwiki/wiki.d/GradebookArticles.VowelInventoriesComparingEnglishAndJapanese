If two words differing only in  a vowel sound have different meanings in the language, then we say that the two vowels are used to create contrast. The size of the vowel inventory refers to the number of vowels used contrastively, and this number varies widely across languages. %0aEnglish is a language with a relatively large vowel inventory. The entry by Steven Moran on PHOIBLE puts the size of American English’s vowel inventory at 15. The size of the vowel inventory of Japanese, on the other hand, is only 5. (Note: These numbers differ a bit in different sources. Both numbers here are from Steven Moran for consistency). In romanized Japanese, the letters ‘a’, ‘i’, ‘u’, ‘e’, and ‘o’ are used to represent the five vowels of the language. This nice one-to-one correspondence between the symbols and the sounds is not present in English. %0aAs a non-native speaker of both English and Japanese, I found it much easier to learn the vowels in Japanese than the ones in English. In fact, I still have trouble distinguishing different vowels in English. Obviously, the difficulty one has in learning how to speak language depends on a lot of factors, but I do wonder if in general, languages with larger vowel (and similarly, consonant) inventories tend to be perceived as more difficult to learn.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/2176%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/2196%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
