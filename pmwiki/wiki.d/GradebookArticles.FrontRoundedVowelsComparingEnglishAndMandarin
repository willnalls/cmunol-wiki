On WALS, these vowels are categorized as high or mid meaning the tongue height can either be high and close to the roof of the mouth or mid around the center. The majority of languages displayed on the map do not use any front rounded vowels, but there are certainly some which do have these vowels and many of these are quite widely spoken.%0a%0aThe English language does not contain any front rounded vowels, but Mandarin contains high front rounded vowels. In English, all front vowels are unrounded. However, in mandarin there is the vowel [ü] where the highest point of the tongue is close to the front of the mouth and the lips are rounded and bunched together. %0a%0aI actually speak both English and Mandarin and so I found this fact particularly interesting. My mom’s name actually has this particular vowel in it and so it’s always quite a process teaching American English speakers how to pronounce her name. This has happened so consistently to the point where she has adopted an unofficial English name that would make it easier for American English speakers to address her. From this example, I think that there’s definitely a possibility that factors such as a vowel not existing in one language can create potential barriers between people. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_mnd%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/1047#tipa%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/160#tipa%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
