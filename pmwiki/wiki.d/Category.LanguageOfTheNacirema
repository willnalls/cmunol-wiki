The main point of the article is to show that any culture can be made to seem peculiar from the outside, challenging us to think about how we represent ourselves vs. others.%0a%0aIf you google “Nacirema”, you will find various other articles that also play on this idea.  Of particular relevance to linguistics is an article by Willard Walker in 1969, called “The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the ti’yčɨr Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture”, which highlights the inconsistencies between the phonological system of English and the way it is taught with respect to its orthography.%0a%0aWhile these articles may seem exaggerated, the presentation of other cultures and languages as exotic continues today, particularly with respect to languages.  One of the most common tropes in the media is a story that observes that a particular language has “no word for X”, or that “X and Y are represented by the same word”, and from this observation, concludes that the people who use that language have a fundamentally different world view.%0a%0aIn this wiki category you are asked to write two paragraphs about the Nacirema.  In the first paragraph, you are to choose a common English word and write a paragraph that illustrates its polysemy.  As an example, consider this paragraph, taken from [[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000128.html | here]], written by John McWhorter*, illustrating the polysemy of the word STAND:%0a%0a''I know we are not supposed to "go there." But then, let's take STAND. You STAND on a corner, you STAND rather than sit, you STAND up. One can STAND pat -- even in an argument. That is, one can STAND up for a thesis, the point can STAND to reason, one can STAND firm on it, STAND down dissenters, and when unrefuted, the point STANDs, although the debate may also end in a STAND-off. We extend that meaning to say that something cannot STAND, and when we are not inclined to let something STAND we cannot STAND it. One person STANDs in for another; a symbol can STAND for a concept. Something noticeable STANDs out. And then when we probe deeper, STAND even lurks sheltered in longer words and seasons their meanings -- we underSTAND an idea, we withSTAND a threat. Then STAND even crosses the line between verb and noun, becoming what we might call a guiding spirit pervading the language. A persistent person may finally make their last STAND. People sell food at STANDs. To performers especially in the old days, a stay in one town was a STAND. You watch a ball game in the STANDs. And then one even hears of STANDs of trees. And STAND tucks itself into other nouns as well -- one may have a unique bodily STANCE, or a STANCE upon an issue of the day.''%0a%0aYou may select your own common word, or you may select from one of the following: table, walk, bank, take, chair, dog, cat.  If you need help thinking of expressions, you can ask Google to define the word for you; if you click on “Translations, word origin, and more definitions”, there is a section at the bottom that includes idiomatic phrases that use the word.%0a%0aIn the second paragraph, you are asked to imagine yourself as a journalist writing about the Nacirema, and, based on your paragraph, write a short description of their belief system and culture, given the polysemy of the word you selected.%0a%0aPlease title your article, “Philosophy lessons from WORD”, where you replace WORD with the word you’ve selected.%0a%0a[=*An important note: In the post from which that paragraph is drawn, McWhorter’s argument is that polysemy in minority languages is often fetishized or exoticized, and this is a legitimate argument.  However, the claim that there is no relationship whatsoever between language and thought is a much stronger claim, and McWhorter does not provide evidence for this stronger claim in the blog post.  We will address linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity in class.  For the purposes of this exercise, McWhorter’s paragraph stands as a good example, but you should not walk away from this exercise thinking that his ultimate point about Mohawk necessarily stands up to scrutiny, or is not controversial.=]%0a%0a!!!Expansions%0a%0aExpansions for this category can take several forms; here are some ideas:%0a* [+ Using the OED, determine the etymology of theword in question, and try to determine if all instances in the paragraph derive from the same word or if some uses are homophones that have different origins.+]%0a* [+ Imagine that you read the journalist’s paragraph about the Nacirema in a local newspaper.  You are appalled at the linguistic sloppiness of the article, and so you decide to write a letter to the editor carefully explaining what is wrong with it.+]%0a* [+ Rewrite the second paragraph with a different interpretation.  For example, if the original author interpreted the polysemy of the word BANK to reflect the fundamentally greedy nature of Nacireman society, then perhaps try to write a paragraph that interprets the polysemy of BANK as reflecting a “oneness with nature”, etc. +]%0a%0a%0a----
