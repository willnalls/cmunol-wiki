Firstly, it will help to bridge a gap between the hearing and deaf communities, allowing members from both to show their appreciation for each other and their differences.  I see in many places that people in the deaf community learn to read lips and speak just to accommodate to the hearing community, but it almost never happens the other way around.  It could also prove to be very useful for people in every day life to communicate if there are people who are far away from each other, if they are eating, or if the environment around them is too loud to speak in.  It can help people with spatial and mapping skills as well as sighted cognition.  And for a lot of people, as they age they become hard of hearing, so this could also help during circumstances like these.  Most importantly, this is able to open a connection to a very rich and diverse community with a lot to offer.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210507-180041-577080#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Community Learns Sign Language for 2 year old %0a-> - Gavin_D%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aHere's a real life example of just what learning sign language can do. A town in Massachusetts saw upwards of 40 people learn sign language to be able to communicate with one of their neighbors, a 2 year old girl born deaf. Doing so was obviously great for the girl, who would walk around despondent, unable to communicate with others but desperately wanting to. Beyond that though, it brought the community together with a common goal & activity they could all share and cherish. As you said, it allowed members of the community to better show appreciation for each other and their differences, in addition to the host of other benefits.%0a%0ahttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/newton-massachusetts-sign-language-community-learns-sign-language-for-deaf-girl/%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210507-180041-577080#%0a#foxbegin 210508-022237-785520#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Pros to learning sign language %0a-> - sathyas%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThere are cognitive benefits to learning any new language and becoming multilingual is always a marketable skill. Some of the cognitive benefits include better cognition, reading comprehension, and spatial awareness as you had listed. I am sure there are many more that are specific to learning ASL rather than any language. Knowing sign language can also be a marketable skill for many positions that would normally include verbal exchange. Occupations like nurses or doctors and sales can benefit from knowing sign language. Another key benefit is that many people get worsened or completely lose their hearing ability later in life. From the source below: "About 2 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss. The rate increases to 8.5 percent for adults aged 55 to 64. Nearly 25 percent of those aged 65 to 74 and 50 percent of those who are 75 and older have disabling hearing loss." Learning sign language can be an extreme benefit to older populations, so learning sign language at a young age when it is easiest to acquire may be worth it later in life.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-022237-785520#%0a#foxbegin 210508-131825-591560#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Audism %0a-> - Abi_S%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aYou mention that if everyone learns sign language, that this would bridge the gap between hearing and deaf communities, which I completely agree.
