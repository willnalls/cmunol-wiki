For example: %0a[AAE error] “Only when someone pushes hisself does he see how disciplined he is.” (hisself for himself)%0a[ESL error] “You shouldthis time use wisely to achieve the task for the day.” (word order)%0a[SAE error] "Adding a little self-discipline in your life can be the difference between success, and failure." (unnecessary comma)%0a%0aFinally, researchers tallied the failure rate after raters had finished grading. They found that raters tend to think some patterns of errors more serious, as data showed a systematic bias against the AAE errors: across three different qualities, essays containing AAE errors are more likely to fail the test than their counterparts do. On the other hand, raters were not as critical of ESL errors as SAE errors. %0a%0aSource: %0ahttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S107529351100047X%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
