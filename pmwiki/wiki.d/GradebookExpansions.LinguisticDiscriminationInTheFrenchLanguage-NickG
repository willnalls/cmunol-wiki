I think a part of this trend towards prescriptivism is the side effect that some French speakers criticize non-native speakers of French for "incorrect pronunciation." I was reminded of this by a TikTok that blew up which featured a French speaker calling the American pronunciation of "charcuterie" [ʃɑrˌku təˈri] as incorrect because it is different from a native French speaker's pronunciation of it as [ʃar kütəˈri]. In this instance, "charcuterie" is being adopted into American English as a loan word, and as such it has a different pronunciation because American English speakers naturally have different sounds available to them than native French speakers. But the prescriptivist nature around the French language currently is what causes some native speakers to view the American pronunciation as wrong when it is just the adaptation of the word into American English.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
