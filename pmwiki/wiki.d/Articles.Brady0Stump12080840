An alternative method of traditional sign language for the non-hearing or the non-verbal is cued speech, a phonetics based system of communication. Cued speech was developed in 1966 by R. Orin Cornett at Gallaudet. The system was developed after Cornett learned that students with severe hearing impairments tended to have much worse reading ability and comprehension when compared to other students. The theory behind this phenomenon is that, while English spelling is by no means a perfect system, there is still a major connection between spoken and written English, and one can learn the 24 letters in the English alphabet, and be able to at least basically understand written english. Those who had been deaf their whole lives on the other hand, knew only sign language, and were unable to make these connections between spoken or signed language, and written language. Cued speech, with its phonetic components, allows the hearing impaired to learn a spoken language directly and develop a connection between the phonemes of that language and the written word.%0a%0aCued speech is usually signed using one hand. Cued speech tailored for the american english phonology consists of 8 different hand shapes, used to indicate consonant, and 8 different positions/movements on and round the mouth area, used to indicate vowel. One unique aspect of cued speech is each “sign” can correspond to multiple different sounds. These sounds are able to be differentiated as those signing mouth the words they are signing as they sign them. Each hand shape indicated 3 to 4 consonants, and each hand position indicated 1 to 3 vowels, each easily differentiated by the mouth shape. For example, the english word “day” would be cued with the pointer finger moving from the chin to the throat, signing [de] (in IPA), followed by an open hand, indicating vowel only, at the corner of the mouth, indicating [ɪ]. Cued speech has been adapted and added to by many other languages that require different phonemes, and has been adapted for over 60 languages and dialects around the world.%0a%0aOn a personal note, cued speech is something that got me interested in linguistics. It was and still is a common sight in my home school system of Fairfax county, Virginia, and was more of a common sight than ASL, and my mother also works as a cued speech transliterator. I personally believe it’s a great system and it's a shame I hear so little about it outside my home county.%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cued_speech#History%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221210-042434-508080#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!How Cued Speech Can Be Helpful For Those Without Hearing Impairments %0a-> - manu%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 20:24-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-042434-508080 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAlthough it was created for people who are hearing impaired, cued speech is actually well suited to help many students with special needs, regardless of their hearing status.
