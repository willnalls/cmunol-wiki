While hearing aids are external devices used to amplify sound, CIs require surgical implantation. They work by bypassing damaged areas and "directly simulating the auditory nerve". Deaf people are unable to hear because of a damaged cochlea (auditory nerve), which is essentially replaced by the CI. The signals are then sent down the path of the auditory nerve to the brain which can then identify and process as sound. The audio heard through a CI is different than that of the natural auditory nerve and takes time to adapt, but it can allow deaf individuals to hear environment sounds and listen/understand to speech once trained.%0a%0aSo why are CIs controversial within the deaf community?%0a%0aThe deaf community perceives CIs as a insult to their community as they feel that they are already able to live full capable and functional lives. Thus, they feel that having deaf children receive CIs is a threatening act from the hearing majority towards the deaf minority. The deaf community's perception is that nothing needs to be fixed, and our perception (the hearing community) is that something needs to be fixed and we should assist them. It spreads the idea that this group of people needs "fixing". Deaf culture is like any other minority group and would like to preserve itself to maintain a supportive community.%0a%0aAnother controversial aspect of CIs is that they are not a miracle cure as many hearing individuals view it as. The initial installation is very mentally taxing and exhaustive, ringing background noises are often common until the brain adapts, certain environments are still difficult to hear in, and some users may never be able to fully understand conversation. Lastly, many hearing parents will often fail to teach their deaf child ASL once a cochlear is installed following the belief that it is a miracle cure.%0a%0aCochlear Implants threaten the deaf community by indicating that they need fixing and are often not an ideal solution to deafness. These reasons cause CIs to be controversial amongst the deaf community.%0a%0ahttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cochlear-implant-controversy/#:~:text=The%2520culture%2520rebelled%2520against%2520attempts,to%2520be%2520their%2520native%2520language. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913847/ https://www.insider.com/why-deaf-people-turn-down-cochlear-implants-2016-12%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210506-005220-754260#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Same Controversy Present in Spoken Languages %0a-> - sirisha_b%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think it is interesting to point out that a common thing hearing people may say to people who are deaf is "Oh, don't you want to be able to hear?  It will make your life easier." with the assumption that if we were to put hearing and deaf on a scale, hearing would always be better and cause less problems for that person.  First of all, this isn't true, especially if being deaf is what the person is familiar and comfortable with.  But that is only because we live in a world that has more hearing people and is mainly tailored for hearing people without considering the needs of those in the deaf community.%0aThe same phenomenon can be seen for speakers of other languages aside from English, or those who don't have a standardized American accent.  People who are in the majority will tell those who aren't that it is better to make the change, but they completely disregard that what seems different to them is completely normal to others.  As a society, we need to get better at accommodating to the needs of everyone and acknowledging that different is never worse when it comes to differences in language.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210506-005220-754260#%0a#foxbegin 210506-050214-93160#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Two Considerations on Cochlear Implants %0a-> - VikramM%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aWhile researching for the linguistic discrimination in the wild category, I came across discussion of the bias in the medical field in favor of cochlear implants.

Deaf people are unable to hear because of a damaged cochlea (auditory nerve), which is essentially replaced by the CI. The signals are then sent down the path of the auditory nerve to the brain which can then identify and process as sound.
