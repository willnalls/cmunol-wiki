I find this difference very interesting because English and Spanish have nearly identical alphabets, and yet with 5 identical vowel symbols in both languages, English has 11 vowel sounds whereas Spanish has 5 that correspond with the vowel symbols. My open-ended question is whether or not the small number of vowel sounds in Spanish is restrictive, or if the large number of vowel sounds in English makes learning the language unnecessarily hard.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221006-215215-563290#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Spanish vs German speakers learning English vowels %0a-> - ricky%0a-> [-06.10.2022 - 14:52-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221006-215215-563290 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe following article details an experiment performed whereby Spanish and German speakers were measured on their ability to learn the English vowel inventory over the course of multiple sessions: (http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1082/1082.pdf). The article makes note of how Spanish has a limited vowel inventory compared to English and German, and the researchers assumed that this limitation would allow Spanish speakers to learn English vowels much more efficiently than German since the new phonemes would appear completely foreign. They assumed German speakers would find it harder to learn English vowels, however, since German possesses a large vowel inventory as well, therefore the speakers would have trouble distinguishing one vowel from another. After performing the experiment, (whereby the speakers were provided with the vowel pronunciation and later asked to recall which vowel was spoken in an audio clip) Spanish speakers were found to struggle to learn the new vowels, particularly in comparison to the German speakers. The learning efficiency rate for Spanish speakers was 10%25 while the rate for German speakers was 20%25. In particular, the Spanish speakers were only able to learn to distinguish the vowels for "bot" and "bought," while they struggled to distinguish other vowels even after training.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221006-215215-563290#%0a#foxbegin 221007-005916-233450#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Possible outlook on how Spanish Speakers intially adapt to English vowelsnish  %0a-> - drjiang%0a-> [-06.10.2022 - 17:59-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221007-005916-233450 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe article attached below dictates a study into the variations between Spanish Speakers speaking English and native English speakers. The study gleams some light into how Spanish Speakers could use some variation of different vowel sounds to substitute for the unknown English vowels. I will focus on vowels specifically, although the paper also goes further in depth into consonants as well. Seection 4.2 lists several mispronunciations somng Spanish speakers speaking English which could be due to the linguistics barriers from being more familiar with Spanish. For example, The English /ae/ does not exist in Spanish, therefore, Spanish speakers are not used to producing such a sound and therefore emulate it with /eh/ which is more familiar to them and sounds close enough to the actual vowel sound. This tendency towards substituting unknown sounds with combinations of known sounds to create a likewise output is a possible solution Spanish speakers implement to express english more accurately. Such a variation between language vowels definitely impacts how Spanish Speakers speak English, but they are still able to adapt with known sounds int heir native language.%0a%0aArticle: http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/paper/hong_euro05.pdf%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221007-005916-233450#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)%0a(:Title: Vowel Inventories : Comparing English and Spanish:)
