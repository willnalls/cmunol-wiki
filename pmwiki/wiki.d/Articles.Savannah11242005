In many cases, when newborns fail a hearing test and are candidates for cochlear implants, small electronic devices that allow severely deaf people to perceive sounds through the stimulation of auditory nerves, parents are often told to speak to the babies as if they were normal to prevent delay in spoken language development (1). However, research show that implanted deaf children often ends up with limited language skills (1). %0a%0aIt should be noted that hearing through a cochlear implant is not like normal hearing and requires training for the brain to comprehend to sound it perceives (1). Moreover, the understanding of speech among implanted people is variable, and sign language is shown to accelerate language development in implanted children (2). Research conducted on a group of first-generation and second-generation cochlear-implanted children showed that second-generation deaf children performed better on language development tests, suggesting that teaching deaf children sign language before cochlear implantation is beneficial to language development (2). Therefore, it can be seen how the misconception that learning sign language could hamper language development hinders speech development (1). Additionally, sign language must be introduced to children as early as possible because there is an optimum age for acquiring languages, including sign language (1). Similar to the decline in one’s ability to learn a new language after a certain age, studies have shown cases where deaf children with later sign language exposure had difficulty learning complex sign language grammatical structures (1).%0a%0aPeople should be aware that learning sign language does not hinder a child’s spoken language development.
