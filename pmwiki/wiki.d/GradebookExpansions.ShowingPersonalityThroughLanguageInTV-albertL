Sentence ending particles, (終助詞, shuujoshi) are used often in the Japanese language to denote the grammatical structure of a sentence or to add nuance in communication. For example, ending a sentence with “か” (/kɐ/) denotes that the previous statement is “unknown”, for the purpose of questions or marking indefinite pronouns. Sentence ending particles are also used to add personality or emphasis to statements. For example, “さ” (/sɐ/) is used as an statement emphasis marker, and is primarily seen in masculine speech. An example of a sentence ending that wasn’t conveyed in subtitling occurred in the 1st episode of Vivy - Flourite Eye’s Song, where the female character Momoka uses the sentence ending particle “わよ” (/wɐjo/), an emphatic feminine sentence ending particle consisting of an opinion marker followed by a emotional emphasis marker. %0a    %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a:Category: Varia%0a:Expansion: Other Examples of personality through language which are lost in translation%0a:Author: albert_l%0a:Original: [[Articles.ShowingPersonalityThroughLanguageInTV|ShowingPersonalityThroughLanguageInTV]] %0a:OriginalAuthor: [[Profiles.ayush_d|ayush_d]]%0a:Section: A%0a:Completed: 08.05.2021 - 19:56%0a:Status: complete%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a%0a%25red%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25red%25 '''Comments to student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0a    An aspect of the Japanese language which also seems to be lost in translation or not properly conveyed through subtitling are sentence endings.
