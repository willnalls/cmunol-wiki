The morphological stage of analysis requires identifying morphemes like prefixes/suffixes, singularization/pluralization, inflection/lemmatization, and spell-checking. While morphological analysis is done at the word level, syntactical analysis is done at the sentence level. A common tool to help with this are parse trees: ordered trees used to represent the syntactic structure of a sentence. Parse trees can be broken up into two main categories: constituency-based and dependency-based. The main difference between the two is that constituency-based parse trees distinguish between terminal and non-terminal grammar while dependency-based parse trees do not. Non-terminals are similar to categories like “greeting, name, surname”, but terminals are what goes in those categories like “hi, John, Doe”. %0a%0aHere’s a picture to illustrate the difference between terminal and non-terminal! :) %0ahttps://i.stack.imgur.com/fsTgs.png%0a%0aAfter learning about sentence and word structure, we can begin to extract the meaning of a sentence with semantics and pragmatics. Some tasks that have to be performed in the semantic layer of analysis include Named-Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction. NER aims to classify named entities into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, and locations. Relationship Extraction is about finding semantic similarity between words (i.e. car is related to road, bus, and driving). At the pragmatic level, we’re trying to comprehend the entire text. Some subfields of pragmatic analysis include topic modeling, summarization, questions and answering. %0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://towardsdatascience.com/linguistic-knowledge-in-natural-language-processing-332630f43ce1%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#:~:text=Natural%2520language%2520processing%2520(NLP)%2520is,amounts%2520of%2520natural%2520language%2520data.%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
