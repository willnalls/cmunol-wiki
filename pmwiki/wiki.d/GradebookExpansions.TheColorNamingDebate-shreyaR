A study was conducted in 2007 where English and Russian speaking participants were presented with shades of blue that fell on either side of the light blue/dark blue border, and much like with OvaHimba speakers and green, the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between the shades much more easily than English speakers. Furthermore, a similar study was conducted some time later on Greek and German speakers (Greek distinguishes between light and dark blue while German does not), in which their ability to detect the difference between light and dark blue was compared to their ability to detect the difference between dark green and dark blue. Similar to the previous study, it was found that Greek speakers performed similarly on both tests while German speakers did much better on the green/blue one. Furthermore, the Greek speakers did not have the same advantage when distinguishing between light/dark green. This goes to show how language can have an impact on perception.%0a%0ahttps://www.thecut.com/2019/01/this-study-on-russian-blues-broke-my-brain.html%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
