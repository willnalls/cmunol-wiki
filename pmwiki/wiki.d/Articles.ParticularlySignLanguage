In Ancient Greek, Socrates is quoted as saying “If we had neither voice nor tongue, and yet wished to manifest things to one another, should we not, like those which are at present mute, endeavor to signify our meaning by our hands, head, and other parts of the body?” pointing to an early rudimentary sign-language used by non-hearing people to communicate. During this same period, unfortunately, Aristotle propagated the idea that speech is the only way to teach people, and as deaf people could not understand speech they were impossible to educate. This idea caught hold and throughout most of history following, widespread institutional discrimination against the deaf existed as they weren't allowed to hold property and were disinherited, they weren't allowed to marry, and were generally cast aside. This marginalization and avoidance of attempting to teach and communicate with deaf people meant that there was little room for a way for the deaf to communicate to develop. This doesn't mean that no one tried to teach the deaf however, as Archbishop of York John Beverly taught a deaf boy to speak. This act wasn't seen as evidence the deaf could be educated and communicated with, however, but rather this was seen as a divine miracle.%0aMuch later, an Italian physician named Girolamo Cardano disagreed with this sentiment and said that those without hearing could still learn ideas and he developed a code of hand gestures that was like and early sign language. Cardano taught his own son, who was deaf, using this code but the code didn't gain widespread. This didn't stop Cardano's ideas from spreading and the prevailing thought that the deaf were unable to be educated was challenged. A few Spanish monks began teaching deaf students, one such monk named Juan Pablo de Bonet published the first book regarding sign language in 1620 which detailed a system of finger spelling.%0aLater a French priest named Abbe Charles Michel de l’Eppe began teaching deaf students and later used his own funds to open a public school for sign language in 1760, which led to the opening of 21 schools for the deaf and mute across France. L'Eppe's method stood out in particular because of his focus on teaching through sign language versus other methods which focus on teaching deaf students  verbal speech in an attempt to help integrate into hearing society and he became a leader in both deaf education and advocacy for the full rights of deaf people. %0aIn the colonization of North America, Massachusetts colonists had a unique genetic predisposition to deafness, which lead to the formation of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language. Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts had a large population of deaf people and thus developed the most developed signing languages up until then, and was used and understood throughout the region among the hearing and non-hearing alike. The large presence of deafness in these Massachusetts communities meant that a fully developed sign language became common place and the deaf and hearing were able to live together fully integrated with equal status.%0aAnother major step in sign-language development in America is the founding of America's first public sing language school by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, who studied the French l'Eppe system as a basis for his education style. This school became the origin for what is now known as ASL, and Gallaudet's pupil opened 22 schools around the US and his son opened the first college for the deaf, the Columbia Institution for the Deaf in DC. During this time however, many in the realm of deaf education taught strictly orally and focused on teaching lip-reading and speaking instead of sign. One of the more famous advocates was Alexander Graham Bell, who believed the deaf should learn to understand speech and be able to speak themselves.%0athe Milan Conference in 1880 was a conference of deaf educators from different countries to come up with a consensus on the education of deaf students. Most of those in attendance subscribed to the oralist model of teaching speech, and voted to outright ban sign language from all schools.%0aLater a linguist named William Stokoe observed that ASL was its own unique language with a unique grammar and syntax which made it its own language rather than a mimic of spoken language that it was thought of at the time. Stokoe published an ASL dictionary in 1960 and lead to the positive reception of ASL among educators again and it was embraced as the official language for the American Deaf Community. Nowadays many countries have their own sign languages that are unique for the deaf signers in those regions and it is used as a primary method of communication for a large amount of deaf people globally.%0a%0asources:%0ahttps://aslblog.goreact.com/2017/04/19/the-history-of-sign-language/%0ahttps://aslblog.goreact.com/2017/04/13/celebrating-200-years-of-american-sign-language/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: SignLanguage:)%0a(:if authgroup @tas:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]]%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!SignLanguage]]%0a%0a!History of language among non-hearing people, particularly sign language%0a%0a:Author: BrandtE%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aIn this article I discuss the history of language use of non-hearing people and the development of sign%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aDeaf people are often times not focused on in history, but throughout human history deaf people existed, lived, and communicated before the widespread use of more standardized sign languages.
