The outcome of her project was BANKing on research that she planned on conducting at a food BANK. She continued her walk and passed an emBANKment. At this point, she started to think about the logistics of her project. She needed to go to a BANK before the project went BANKrupt and take out some money to fund the project. She placed this reminder in her memory BANK for later. At that moment, a BANK of dark clouds formed overhead and she scrambled up a steep BANK to get back to her car. Thankfully, the river had been BANKed so it wouldn’t overflow. She decided to drive to the BANK. There, she talked to the BANKteller to retrieve funds, passing a BANK of ATM machines. Afterwards, she drove back home with her money fresh from the BANK.%0a%0aThe Nacirema seems to be a society that cares a lot about wealth and keeping track of things. For example, ‘memory’, ‘money’, and ‘food’ all seem to be in a “bank” of some sort. “Banks” act as storage for things that people need to use and necessities. They have to go to banks to get both material and nonmaterial items for daily use. The Nacirema prioritize collecting and putting things into “banks,” relying on these things for various tasks. This reliance is also heavily focused on in their society. They also like to use the word “bank” to talk about nature and dirt which seems completely different from the collection idea that “bank” also seems to be about. The Nacirema is a very divided society which is split between those who care about money and those who care about nature forms. %0a%0aSource: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bank%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
