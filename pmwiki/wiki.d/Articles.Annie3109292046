[1] Voicing, on the other hand, describes the vibration of “airflow over vocal folds.” [2] While pronouncing voiced sounds requires airflow for vibration, plosives simply stop the airflow: due to the contradiction, only some languages have voiced plosives. [3]%0a%0aIn English, plosives can be voiced or voiceless. [4] For the voiceless plosives [p, t, k], the vocal folds are “pulled apart” when “the oral constriction” is made; for the voiced plosives [b, d, g], the vocal folds are “held together throughout” so voicing can “continue through the constriction.” [5] On the other side, Mandarin Chinese only has voiceless plosives, which are subdivided into unaspirated ones and aspirated ones. [6] Similar to English, the unaspirated voiceless plosives in Mandarin Chinese are [p, t, k]. To draw a difference, in the IPA chart, the aspirated voiceless plosives [ph, th, kh] are denoted with an “h” on the top right corner. [7]%0a%0aComparing the composition of word in the two languages, a main distinguishing point would be the arrangements of consonants (C) and vowels (V). English offers multiple syllable structures ranging from the simple V to the complex CCCVCCC, and plosives can be placed either before or after the vowel. In contrast, syllable structures in Mandarin Chinese consists of “an optional initial consonant + vowel (accompanied by tone) + optional final consonant (n or ng),” [8] which implies that plosives only appear as word initials. Taking syllable structure into account, perhaps the arrangements of plosives (whether word-initials or not) can explain why Mandarin Chinese leaves out voiced plosives.%0a%0aReference%0a[1] Zsiga, E.
