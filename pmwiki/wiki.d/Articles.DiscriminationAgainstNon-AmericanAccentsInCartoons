Most commonly, villain characters are cast as having a general Slavic, German, or British English. However, these accents are not particularly accurate to a region. For example, in the word "darling", the final velar plosive is left unvoiced, and [wi] is pronounced as [vi], but these are stereotyped generally Slavic-accented approximations, but not actually particularly accurate or belonging to one dialect. This example of linguistic discrimination is not an outright bias against specifically Slavic dialects, but groups an entire region's worth of language bases into a generally East European accent that is only distinctly defined as different from American English. This is additionally concerning because the writers of these cartoons aren't intentionally attempting to discriminate against these dialects of English so much as upholding the status quo that their industry has found itself in. Even when shows like Kim Possible are attempting to have diverse representation in terms of gender, they still use these stereotypes that (likely unintentionally) serve to teach children that foreign accents are both othering and undesirable.%0a%0ahttps://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/01/why-do-cartoon-villains-speak-in-foreign-accents/549527/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210504-180758-651380#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!The villanous stereotype and it's relationship to U.S. international relations %0a-> - chester_g%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think this is a very interesting article that I didn't fully realize was a commonly portrayed stereotype.
