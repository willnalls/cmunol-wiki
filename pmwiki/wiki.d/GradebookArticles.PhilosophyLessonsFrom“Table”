A multi purposeful raised flat surface that is used as a place to eat, work, and gather, the name itself has been used in many different contexts to describe multiple aspects of life. For example, in order to indicate that someone brings great skill or experience to a situation, event, or group of people, that person is “bringing something to the table”. If someone’s fortunes are reversed, the phrase commonly used is: “the tables are turning”. A further question that must be investigated is the origin of this phrase, are the tables physically turned in order to reverse bad luck? Finally, these people seem to be drunkards as they commonly overindulge in alcoholic beverages, leading to the phrase “under the table” commonly used to describe a person who is very inebriated. Many more uses of the word table abound, leading this journalist to believe that the table is a revolutionary invention central focus of life in Nacirema culture. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
