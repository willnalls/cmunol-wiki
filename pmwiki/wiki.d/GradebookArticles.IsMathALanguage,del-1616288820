Mostly because it's semi-commonly referred to as a universal language, and it can be used to communicate really complex ideas. It has its own set of symbols, each which conveys meaning. There's large groups of people that understand it and rely on it heavily to communicate their ideas. As well, it definitely has a concept of grammar and syntax, as symbols need to be combined in a certain way in order for them to make sense to the interpreter. It even has elements of dialects-- for example, depending on geographic area, it might be true that the symbol N (referring to the natural numbers) refers to 0, and in other areas, N does not refer to 0. In the same wave of thinking, though, it can't communicate a large portion of what we would think of as normal usage for a language. For example, there's no way to communicate a feeling through math, which most other languages have. I don't know that this precludes it from being a language, though-- it serves the purpose of its set of users, and it's not common, if ever, that users of mathematics feel they can't effectively write a mathematical statement down using the existing symbols. It's an interesting concept either way, especially noticing how many people on the introduction message board noted their interest in math.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----
