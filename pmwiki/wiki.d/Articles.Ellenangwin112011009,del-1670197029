With the technology available, many hearing people would wonder why someone would choose not to get an implant. In the Deaf community, however, cochlear implants are not always looked at in a positive way. %0a%0aFirst of all, cochlear implants imply that deafness is a disability that needs to be “fixed”. In the Deaf community, deafness is not regarded as a disability; deaf people are proud to be Deaf and have a strong community built around their language, history, and shared experiences. To those in the Deaf community, deafness is not just the inability to hear, but it is also a culture. Cochlear implants and romanticizing their use shows that the hearing community does not understand or appreciate Deaf culture. Further, their use implies that we expect the Deaf community should learn how to communicate with the hearing world, not the other way around. This can be offensive because it can seem like the hearing world doesn’t appreciate Deaf culture, and also doesn’t want to learn how to communicate with its members. Further, the use of cochlear implants threatens the existence of Deaf culture, because it causes the community to lose members.   %0a%0aAdditionally, hearing people may assume that cochlear implants allow people to hear exactly like us. This is not true; people with cochlear implants do not have fully “restored” hearing, and often it takes many months for the brain to rewire itself in order to process the new sensory information. Even after they have adapted, it is common for those who use cochlear implants to have difficulty telling apart different sounds, especially when there is a lot of background noise. Many users of cochlear implants still rely on lip reading to understand those around them.%0a%0aAlthough we might think that cochlear implants are very useful tools for those who are deaf, we need to understand that they can be offensive to the Deaf community. Even though they help communication, people who use cochlear implants still do not have the same experience as hearing people. Although it is difficult for the hearing community to understand the experiences of those who are deaf, we need to respect their culture and their opinions, and understand that implants are a controversial subject to the Deaf community,%0a%0aCooper A.
