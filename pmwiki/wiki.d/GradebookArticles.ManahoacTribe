They are sometimes referred to as the Manahock or Mahock.  Its IPA transcription is [mænəhoʊk].  The Manahoacs no longer exist as a distinct tribe; they merged with their neighbors a few centuries ago.%0aThere are no treaties currently that relate to this land.%0aAs far as their language goes, it was challenging to find any verifiable information at all. Since the Manahoacs are no longer a tribe, their language has disappeared as well.  According to the Native Land website, the territory of the Manahoacs had people who spoke Conoy and Tutelo.  Other websites more generally say they were a Siouan-speaking group and actually rivals with the Algonquian-speakers, but their name is translated from Algonquian on almost every website.  These are two of the three major linguistic groups in Virginia; the last one is Iroquoian.  There are many thousands of speakers of Siouan languages across the country today.  Because of this, there are also a good amount of resources online to learn the language, specifically the type spoken in the Dakotas since this is where it is currently most prevalent. I couldn't find any specifics about uses since it is such a broad category of languages.%0aThe non-indigenous websites have more specifics about the history of the language and its current number of users.  They also had more insight as to why this tribe spoke certain language and how it relates to their neighboring tribes.  I think this tribe overall doesn't have much information from indigenous sources, so any non-indigenous ones will have more information.  One interesting thing to note is that the indigenous sites spoke about the history in more of a story-telling manner and had a lot more information about the relationships formed between neighboring tribes while the other sites felt more like reading a textbook.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://mahockney.org/home/naming-mahockney/%0ahttps://native-land.ca%0ahttps://accessgenealogy.com/virginia/manahoac-tribe.htm%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/manahoac.htm%0ahttp://www.virginiaplaces.org/nativeamerican/manahoac.html%0ahttps://www.mustgo.com/worldlanguages/siouan-language-family/%0ahttp://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/Indians-101-The-Siouan-Language-Family%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manahoac%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
