This sentence repeats “had” four times in a row but is somehow still grammatically correct. Not as crazy as the buffalo example, however this sentence is still challenging to read. The reason it is grammatical is because it uses the double use of the past perfect. The two “had had” play different roles in the sentence and can be combined to create the sentence above. The first use of the double had is the modifier and the second use of the double had is the main verb. Together these are grammatical which makes it fun to read in a sentence.%0a%0aSource: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/confusing-sentences-actually-make-sense/ %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
