I wanted to know if there was a reason for this or if it was because I was not trying hard enough. I found that some brains are more equipped to learn a new language due to connections in the brain centered around reading and speaking. As I am a math oriented person, I wonder if this is why language learning is so difficult for me. The reason language is so hard to learn is because the way you learn it is so different than the way you learn other subjects, such as history. You cannot just memorize a bunch of words and rules and expect to learn a new language (which is what I was trying to do). Another reason it would be hard to learn a new language depends on how similar the new language is to your native language. If the new language is much different and uses different sounds, then there are neurological challenges that get in your way. As we get older, it is harder to learn a new language, as we put so much pressure on ourselves and over-analyze every little part of the language, thus making it even more difficult to learn.%0a%0aSource: https://www.ef.edu/blog/language/why-learning-a-language-is-hard/#:~:text=But%252C%2520why%2520is%2520it%2520so,more%2520to%2520it%2520than%2520that. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210504-200116-171840#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Children learn new languages quicker than adults %0a-> - angelaw%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think you definitely bring up a good point in that some people are more comfortable with certain methods of learning and learning new languages is definitely a complex arena where many people struggle.

Another reason they learn quicker which I found quite fascinating was because of children's overall lower self-consciousness. Kids are not afraid to "sound dumb" or make mistakes when trying to say new things out loud which helps them gain more practice and learn quicker.
