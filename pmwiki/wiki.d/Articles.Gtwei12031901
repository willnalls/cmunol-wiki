At the conference, it was decided that “oral education was better than manual (sign) education” (1), and thus effectively resulted in a ban on teaching sign language in schools. The only delegates at the conference who opposed the statute were those from the United States and the United Kingdom, but they were easily outnumbered. The only deaf delegate present at the conference was James Denison of the United States (3).%0a%0aSchools instead turned to speech therapy and teaching lip-reading. This resulted in deaf teachers losing their jobs, and an overall decline in the education of people who were hard of hearing (1). Over time, there were less deaf people in professions such as politicians, writers, artists, lawyers, etc. (2).%0a%0aIt wasn’t until the late 1900s when sign language education began to return to classrooms. In 1970, William Stokoe, a linguistics professor at Gallaudet College, “declared sign language a true language” (1). Gallaudet college was also one of the few schools who chose to keep sign language on their campus. There were also more recent developments. In 2010, the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf met in Vancouver, and officially removed all of the bans that were instituted by the Milan Conference (3). A formal apology was also issued.%0a%0aSign language has since become much more prevalent. But overall, the Milan Conference of 1880 had serious consequences on Deaf education. It is now viewed as a symbol of sign language oppression (2), and is a reminder as to why accessible communication is so important.%0a%0a%0a1) https://www.verywellhealth.com/deaf-history-milan-1880-1046547%0a2) https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=238%0a3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_International_Congress_on_Education_of_the_Deaf%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-045159-127610#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Milan Conference was a mistake %0a-> - williamh57%0a-> [-08.12.2022 - 20:51-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-045159-127610 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aLooking back on it, the conclusions of that conference were definitely misguided.
