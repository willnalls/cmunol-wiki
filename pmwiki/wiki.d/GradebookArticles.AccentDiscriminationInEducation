Reports and interviews suggest that there is a "toxic" attitude towards students with a regional dialect/pronunciation, such as a northern England accent.

When I was in middle school, I participated in an exchange program to a well-reputed grammar school in the UK (a Grammar school in the UK is somewhat equivalent to a private school). Back then, I and some of my friends spoke English with a noticeable accent. By the end of the program, my classmates in the program who spoke with less accent blended into the host school's community much better. Some I have reasons to believe that discrimination does exist in prestigious institutions.%0a%0aAs a second language speaker of English, while I strive to speak the best Standard American English as I could, it is in all of our best interest to combat accent discrimination.
