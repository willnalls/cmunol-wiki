Many SAT staring, weighed down by the stress that SAT on their shoulders from the importance of the test. One students glasses SAT squarely on his nose as he read through all his prompts. He read about a government whose president SAT for only 2 years, and answered questions about obscure vocabulary terms. He read about the experiences of footballers SAT by their managers after a bad performance and identified the figurative language in the essay. The previous weekends, he SAT dogs for their owners, teaching them tricks until they always SAT when you told them. But this SATurday, he was occupied with 4 hours that might make or break his entire life. He SAT back in his chair and buried his head in his hands.%0a%0aThe Nacirema are a society that has societally respected facilities where attendees must pay to work as hard as they can rather than the opposite and the decisions where can influence their standing in society. The entrance process to these facilities is crowned by the dated and hated SAT. They lay completely sedentary during a four hour process as they deposit graphite onto thin rolled sheets of dead organic material. This is emphasized in the word “sat”, which is used all around their language to mean the sedentary aspects of life (a category crowned by the SAT). This wide use of “sat” along with the relentless gluttony displayed by the Nacirema lead me to believe they prize the sedate, even when their leaders attempt to convince them otherwise. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
