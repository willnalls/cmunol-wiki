Many of the meanings of rest have to deal with being stationary and inactive. From this we can tell that they are unmotivated and lazy as they would rather “rest their head on a pillow” than go to the gym and work out. Even in the case of doing an action, such as playing music, the violin player is said to be resting their chin on the chinrest the entire time and waiting for their break in the music so they can take a rest. Lastly, there is a high level of unemployment in the Nacirema society as the people who do not have a job would rather rest than put in the effort required to obtain a job.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
