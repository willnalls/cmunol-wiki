A defining feature of Kolami’s phonology is its contrastive usage of vowel length. It is listed as a critically endangered language in India, with less than 44,805 speakers left according to a 2011 Indian census. While it is still spoken in many of India’s central states, speakers are also fluent in more prominent dialects (including Marathi, and Telugu – both of which are from the same language family). The language goes unnoticed as a dying language due to India’s vast linguistic diversity, despite many more tribal languages in threat of extinction – a large issue is India underreporting the severity of its language preservation efforts, as they don’t list languages with less than 10,000 speakers as official languages. The main reasons that Kolami – like most tribal Indian languages – is dying out, is because of the lack of exposure from printing, and inaccessible education for native speakers. Famous Indian Linguist Dr. Prasanna Sree, who plays a vital role in preserving minority languages in India, has created an orthographic system to represent its phonology and forerun textbook production as means to preserve the language. However, these efforts were heavily impacted by the pandemic, which halted the distribution of these textbooks and education programs/reforms to preserve mother tongue languages in India. %0a%0a1) https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/the-dying-tongues-of-telangana-and-andhra/articleshow/57253816.cms%0a2) https://www.endangeredalphabets.net/alphabets/kolam/%0a3) https://phoible.org/inventories/view/1744#tipa%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: D:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Kolami :)%0a(:if [ authgroup @tas || authgroup @admins || equal {$Author} '' ]:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=edit|Edit this page]] \\%0aStatus: {GradebookArticles.{$Name}$:Status} %0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!{$:Category}]]%0a%0a!Kolami %0a%0a:Author: aarnavp%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aCritical Endangered Kolami – tribal langauge of India%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aKolami is a tribal language of the Central Dravidian Language family across central/south India.
