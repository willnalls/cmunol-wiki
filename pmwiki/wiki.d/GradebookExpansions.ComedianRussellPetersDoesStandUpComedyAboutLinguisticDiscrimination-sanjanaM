Baljeet is one of the characters on the reoccuring cast members on the show. He has a stereotypical Indian accent, and is considered the "nerd" of the show. He's generally weak, and is very socially awkward. At first, it was exciting that there was an animated Indian person on a very popular show, but looking back, it's odd that these stereotypes are pushed on young kids that watch these shows.
