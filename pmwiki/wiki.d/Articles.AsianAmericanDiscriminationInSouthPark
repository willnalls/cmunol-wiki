Specifically, it is making fun of the pronunciation of [l] in English words as [r] and portraying it as ungrammatical. In the clip, the characters are depicted pronouncing "rely" as [ɹɪˈraɪ] instead of the SAE pronunciation [ɹɪˈlaɪ], "intellect" as [ˈɪntərekt] instead of [ˈɪntəlekt], and "look" as [rʊk] instead of [lʊk]. The exaggeration of this linguistic pattern alongside other stereotypical portrayals of the characters gives the impression that this accent is somehow inferior to SAE or ungrammatical in some way.%0a%0aThis accent is common among many Asian immigrants in America, in part because many Asian languages, especially East Asian, do not have a phonological distinction between the [l] and [r] sound. In this clip specifically, South Park is making fun of a Chinese-American accent, but they have portrayed many Asians in a similar way. In every instance, the overemphasis on the linguistic differences between native English speakers and Asian speakers serves to present them as worse Engish speakers than natives, which is an inherently discriminatory portrayal.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210502-184759-609680#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Lampooning vs. Reinforcing stereotypes %0a-> - kevinx%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a(warning: language)%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enOQozXwctc%0a%0aIn the above clip, both Asian characters are voiced by series co-creator Trey Parker.
