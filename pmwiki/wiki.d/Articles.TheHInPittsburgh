Pittsburgh, the most populous 'burg,' adds an 'h' to end of its name - and there is a storied history as to why.%0a%0aDuring its founding in 1758, Pittsburgh was first spelled as "Pittsbourgh:" the city charter changed this name into Pittsburgh in 1816 and official documents called it Pittsburg in the early years. The 'burg' suffix itself comes from the namesake of Pittsburgh, William Pitt, a Scottish-descended former prime minister of England. The words 'burgh' and 'bourgh' are both variations of 'borough,' a word obsolete in British English but continued in Scottish English as a marker for a geographic unit. As you can see, the names were used fairly interchangeably up to 1890, even with different newspapers using different spellings.%0a%0aIn 1890, the federal U.S. Board on Geographic Names was created to standardize the many names given during the expansion of the country. This, of course, meant anglicizing and erasing many of the unique linguistic markers in the names of cities with different cultural heritages. One of these changes was the dropping of h in the spelling of burg - which is why most cities do not use the 'h.' In fact, the report explicitly singled out Pittsburgh in a special listing to change the name. However, most of the population of Pittsburgh did not change their usage: although to outsiders, the city was called ‘Pittsburg,’ the name was almost always spelled with the 'h' in the city. Local institutions, such as the University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Gazette continued to use the 'h,' legitimizing the usage to residents. Although federal institutions, such as post offices, were forced to comply, even official city documents still used the 'h.'%0a%0aAfter two decades of passive resistance, the Board finally relented. In 1911, the federal government returned the 'h' to Pittsburgh after being petitioned by the city council, the mayor, the postmaster, and a senator from Pennsylvania. To this date, it is one of the few burgs in America to include the ‘h,’ continuing to mark the heritage and steadfastness of the city. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://panethos.wordpress.com/2019/12/09/worlds-largest-burg-burgh-or-bourg-suffix-cities/%0ahttps://phlf.org/2000/12/21/the-controversial-spelling-of-pittsburgh-or-why-the-h/%0ahttps://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/history/the-pittsburgh-h/#:~:text=Pittsburgh%2520Loses%2520Its%2520%2522H%2522,name%2520was%2520rendered%2520%2522Pittsburg.%2522%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Pittsburgh%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210509-012145-317990#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-08.05.2021 - 18:21-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210509-012145-317990 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!jjmonroe%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0a %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210509-012145-317990#%0a#foxbegin 210508-042459-705520#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-07.05.2021 - 21:24-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210508-042459-705520 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!AlexX%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aI think this really shows the importance of language in peoples' sense of identity - even though removing the "-h" seems like a negligible change, it made all the difference to the residents of the city. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-042459-705520#%0a#foxbegin 210507-231729-705970#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-07.05.2021 - 16:17-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210507-231729-705970 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!Connor_G%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aWow, this is really interesting!
