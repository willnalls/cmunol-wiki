The man is completely deaf so he uses ASL, and he also communicates through typing with his phone. At the drive-thru window, the first employee attempts to take the order but quickly retrieves what seems to be her manager. The manager then tries talking to the deaf man, but he doesn't understand that deaf people can't hear. As a result, the manager thinks he is faking his disability. Later on, the couple has to wait over 20 minutes for their food to come out because the prepared food was thrown away in the kitchen (since they thought he was faking his disability).%0a%0aIt is very clear from the video that the man is being discriminated against because he is deaf. The employees at Mcdonald's do not take him seriously resulting in unfair treatment. Even though the customer tried to order via typing on his phone, McDonald's still refuses to serve him which shows their ignorance for hearing disabilities. %0a%0aAlthough the languages of English and ASL are completely different, the employees could have given the man the benefit of doubt and at least serve him. Instead, they wasted their own time and resources by throwing out his order. If he was faking it, the wasted food has the same outcome in both scenarios. %0a%0aAs a result of the video, more people should understand ASL or at least be able to communicate around it. All people should be treated with fairness, and it was wrong for employees of McDonald's to dismiss someone's disability and essentially ignore them. I think it would help if at least one person in a business understood ASL to deter future discrimination.  %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
