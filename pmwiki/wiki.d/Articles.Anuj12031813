Many of this family's other sub-dialects are also equally close to extinction. Despite all of this Ume Saami has a particular importance in this region of the world because it was the first language from this family to be written extensively and was a key component of cultural spread. Many of the different dialects from this language family diverge from each other due to geographical barriers. As a result as travel became more and more accessible local dialects have started to fall out of favor for the most dominant member of this language family Northern Sami. Ultimately, this language has fallen out of use in favor of more convenient alternatives over time.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/size-and-vitality/sju%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%25C3%25A1mi_languages%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ume_S%25C3%25A1mi%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: D:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Ume Saami:)
