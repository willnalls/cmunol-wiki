Prior to colonization, this region was controlled by the Mexihcah (pronounced: meːˈʃíʔkaʔ), better known in English as the Aztecs. There were also other Nahua groups living in the area, most of whom paid tribute to the Aztec Empire. There are no formal treaties concerning the Mexihcah but their empire was toppled in 1521 by an army overwhelmingly composed of warriors from rival Nahua groups like the Tlaxcalans as well as some Spanish soldiers. Following this, the region came under Spanish colonial rule. There were about 25 million indigenous people in the Valley of Mexico in 1521 – the vast majority of whom spoke Náhuatl. By the 1600s the number of indigenous people in this region had declined to around 1 million due to disease and forced labor (Source: History of Mexico course).%0a%0aI was not able to find websites by Nahua speakers but according to this website (https://www.elalliance.org/languages/nahuatl) there are currently around 1.5 million Náhuatl speakers. Over 85%25 of Náhuatl speakers know other languages (e.g. Spanish) but there are still hundreds of thousands of monolingual Náhuatl speakers. Some varieties of Náhuatl are endangered or have disappeared but Náhuatl continues to be the primary language used in some parts of central Mexico. Organizations like the Endangered Language Alliance are organizing Náhuatl classes to help preserve the language. %0a%0aThe source I used was from an organization based in New York. As such, it details the experience of native Náhuatl speakers in New York but focuses less on Náhuatl speakers in the Valley of Mexico. A source managed by Náhuatl speakers living in the Valley of Mexico would be able to give more details on the challenges Náhuatl faces in its area of origin. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Mexihcah / Aztec Tribe:)
