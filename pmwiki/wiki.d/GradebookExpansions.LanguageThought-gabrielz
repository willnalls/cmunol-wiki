In fact, it doesn't even have some words relating to time like "before" or "after". Instead, it relies on aspect and mood of verbs, along with context, to convey time information. For one example, an uncertain mood is often used for verbs taking place in the future, as opposed to a more factual one often being used for past tenses, but these same conjugations can be used to speak about a verb in any relative time.
