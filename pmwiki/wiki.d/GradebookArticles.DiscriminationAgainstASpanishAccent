Two people on the call, both of whom were employees for the council/media company, were heard laughing about her accent while she discussed the rollout of COVID vaccines, saying she pronounces words "like she thinks they're pronounced" and mockingly referring to her accent as "cute". Specifically, she pronounced the word "hologram" as "hologɹæm" rather than as "hɑlɑgɹæm". This mirrors the pronunciation of the Spanish word "holograma" (transcribed as "olograma"), indicating that her dialect is influenced by her native language, Spanish. Navarro later talked about how rude and insensitive it was that while she was speaking about important issues such as increasing access to vaccines in POC communities, people were only paying attention to the way she was saying things rather than what she was saying. Additionally, this represents an example of microaggressions towards non-native English speakers as their manner of speaking is looked down upon and results in them not being taken seriously, as if their accent discredits the validity of what they are saying.%0a%0a%0ahttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latina-council-member-nancy-navarro-accent-mocked-claps-back-pride-rcna354%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
