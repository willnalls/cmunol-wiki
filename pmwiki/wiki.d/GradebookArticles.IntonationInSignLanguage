Traditional verbal intonation occurs through the modulation of pitch and tone in order to convey information outside of speech, such as emotion or attitude. Important factors modulated through intonation include loudness, pitch range, tempo, etc. Intonation is similar to body language in its ability to transmit information through non or extra verbal communication. Where intonation and body language differ is in the ability of intonation to highlight certain grammatical and syntactical structures. This is encoded by the IPA through distinct pitch arrows, including rising, falling, peaking, etc. markers, but is generally limited in the quality of intonation that can be expressed.%0a %0aAmerican Sign Language also encodes information outside of the words that are being communicated, having its own distinct intonation system. This intonation system cannot be expressed verbally, and is instead expressed through various aspects of body language. Intonation in ASL follows similar patterns of expression and acquisition as that of traditional verbal languages. Studies on deaf children of ages 5-8 have shown that specific learning patterns of intonation acquisition hold across students as well as across language. Specifically, "appearance, reorganization, and mastery" hold as stages of intonation mastery. The specific expressions of intonation also vary across different sign languages. For example, American and Israeli sign languages hold their own distinct patterns of fixed facial expressions and head movements for specific grammatical structures such as yes / no question distinction as well as subject marker distinction. Ultimately, the amount and quality of intonation in signed and verbal languages are remarkably similar, and speak to the constant need for linguistic expression outside of syntactic and morphological semantics in verbal ad nonverbal communication.%0a%0ahttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/10/141023100428.htm%0a%0ahttps://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/communication/intonation.php%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
