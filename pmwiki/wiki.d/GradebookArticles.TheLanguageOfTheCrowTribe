I hope to visit it one day as it seems to be a scenic location with interesting geothermal features. According to the native-land website, the traditional stewards of the land are the Cheyenne as well as the Crow tribe. In this article, I will focus on the Crow tribe, otherwise known as the Apsáalooke tribe. Apsáalooke is the name used by the tribe in their own language to refer to themselves, and I would transcribe Apsáalooke as \əp̚saloge\.%0a%0aBased on indigenous-run sources, the Crow Tribe is located on the Crow Indian Reservation, which was established by the Fort Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1868. The language of the Crow Tribe, known as the Apsáalooke language, is related to other Siouan languages and appears to be spoken quite widely within the tribe. The Crow tribe estimates around 85%25 of their 11,000 citizens, which amounts to nearly 9500 citizens, speak Crow as their first language. However, tribal leaders have expressed concern that members of the younger generation are speaking an abbreviated version of the Apsáalooke language that resembles English. This implies that the younger generation in the Crow tribe may not be as fluent or familiar with the Apsáalooke language. There are resources available to learn the language, such as the tribe-run Little Big Horn College which teaches both the oral language and the writing system (known as Apsáalooke ammaalaátuua) as well as immersion programs for the younger generation of the tribe to learn the language. %0a%0aFrom non-indigenous-run sources, there seems to be a more pessimistic view of the language, with descriptions such as the Crow Tribe “faces challenges in keeping its language alive”, with a sharp decline in the share of tribal members who speak Crow fluently from 85%25 60 years ago to 30%25 in 2019. Unesco also describes the Crow language as “Definitely Endangered” with 3500 speakers. This conflicts with the information provided within indigenous-run sources. Similar to the indigenous-run sources, there is a focus on the younger generation of the tribe, with a smaller percentage of the younger generation speaking Crow as a first language as compared to older generations. Non-indigenous-run sources also describe the many avenues and resources for learning the language, such as immersion programs, the local tribal college, the tribal government and elders groups. Many of these programs are targeted at the younger generation of the Crow tribe in order to immerse them in the language at a young age. However, these sources also highlight the roles non-tribal organizations play in keeping the language alive, such as efforts by public schools, non-governmental organizations, as well as federal grants. %0a%0aIndigenous-run sources%0ahttp://www.crow-nsn.gov/%0ahttp://ourmothertongues.org/language/Crow/3%0ahttp://www.lbhc.edu/%0a%0aNon-indigenous-run:%0ahttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2019/32-crow-community-wakes-up-its-language%0ahttps://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/keep-speaking-crow-to-me-teens-immerse-themselves-in-native-language/article_48708902-5da1-520e-87fb-30e46e8c981e.html%0ahttp://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&page=atlasmap%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow_language%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
