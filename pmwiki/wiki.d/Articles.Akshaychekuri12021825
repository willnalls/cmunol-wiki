This perception is deeply tied to the history of Black Americans and their enslavement and subsequent systematic discrimination. Due to this history and perception, many people who natively speak AAVE "code switch", or change the way they speak, depending on the situation they find themselves in. In an academic or professional setting, they may find themselves speaking differently from how they would naturally.%0a%0aThis video shows a school in California teaches AAVE speakers to code switch and how the grammer rules differ between Standard American English and AAVE. The language seen as "ungrammatical" as this case is subject-verb agreemnt in plurality for the third person. In the video, the example sentence of AAVE is "My grandpa cook every night." In this case, "cook" is considered grammatical in AAVE because verbs do not have to agree with third-person subjects with regard to plurality. In Standard American English, the grammatical sentence is "My grandpa cooks every night." The verb agrees with the singularity of the subjects by suffixing the -s. AAVE has similarly complete rules of grammar, but they differ slightly.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-084627-680110#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!AAVE other rules %0a-> - haridesikan%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 00:46-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-084627-680110 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe original author here includes one distinction between AAVE and English.%0aIt is interesting to note that there are similarities between AAVE and other languages, too.

Similarly, [My daddy cook dinner] is an example of how tense is rarely expressed in the verb morpheme in AAVE, and some language (like Burmese) are even further distanced from the concept of tense!%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0ahttps://achieve.lausd.net/cms/lib08/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/217/1.13.16%2520Legal%2520Size%2520AAL%2520Common%2520Rules%2520List.pdf%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221209-084627-680110#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: D:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)%0a(:Title: AAVE Code Switching:)
