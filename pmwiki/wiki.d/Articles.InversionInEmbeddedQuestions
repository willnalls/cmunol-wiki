However, this flipping does not occur when forming embedded questions. In the example above, the subject-auxiliary word order in the question is “is it” but in the embedded question is “it is”.%0a%0aHowever, in dialects of English which have inversion in embedded questions, this word order is the same between questions and embedded questions, specifically that it follows the word order of the question.
