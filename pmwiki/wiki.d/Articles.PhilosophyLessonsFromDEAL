"Deal" takes on many different meanings but is commonly used to describe an interaction or exchange of some sort. This suggests the importance of interactions and communication the Nacirema in order for their society to function smoothly. "Deal" also is commonly used in the context of quantifying something in relation to a norm, suggesting that gain in wealth (whatever form that may take) is also important in their culture. Specifically, that societal exchanges and interactions are made to be beneficial to an individual. This suggests that individual gain is viewed as important in the Nacirema society and that their interactions typically function as a means to this end.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: C:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)
