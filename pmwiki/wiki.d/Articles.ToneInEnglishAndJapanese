The most common example is that of Chinese, where pitch, normally described relatively with terms like "low", "high", and "rising", is needed for distinguishing grammatical and lexical meaning. Complex tonal systems can have 8 tones or more.%0a%0aEnglish is not a tonal language, so English words and grammatical meaning are not distinguished based on pitch. However, nontonal languages like English can and do use pitch in their speech. A clear example of this is when an English speaker puts stress on a word, they will often raise the pitch as well.%0a%0aA special class of nontonal languages is languages with a "pitch accent". A pitch accent is when a multisyllabic word has a syllable that is particularly stressed or has a high pitch. In these languages, a particular pitch accent does not distinguish a word from another (which is what separates them from tonal languages) but rather is a reflection of a particular accent. Within pitch accented languages, syllables are thought of as either low-unstressed or high-stressed.%0a%0aJapanese is an example of a language with a sophisticated pitch accent. In standard Japanese, there are a small handful of words that can be distinguished based on pitch. For example, chopsticks ([háɕì] HAshi) and bridge ([hàɕí] haSHI). A plurality of words have a different pitch accent based on location and accent type. For example, the word for medicine in the Tokyo accent [kɯ̀sɯ̀ɾí] (kusuRI) and in the Kyoto accent [kɯ̀sɯ́ɾì] (kuSUri). There are patterns of which syllables to be stressed and unstressed for each particular accent, which are grouped in major types like Tokyo, Keihan, Sanuki, and Awashima.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210225-035921-954510#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Maybe it's not as bad for new Japanese speakers as it seems! %0a-> - TimG%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI came across a blog post that made an interesting argument about Japanese pitch accents: Pitch accents a major factor in becoming conversationally fluent in the language.
