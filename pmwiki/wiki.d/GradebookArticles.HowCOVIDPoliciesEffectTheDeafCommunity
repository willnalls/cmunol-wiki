Rules and products are often made and only redesigned after concerns about accessibility are raised. The same is true about COVID-19 mitigation policies. Because of COVID-19, many new rules have been implemented to try to limit the spread of the virus. People have been encouraged to wear face masks and coverings as much as possible, and limits have been placed on the number of people allowed to gather in indoor spaces. These virus mitigation rules have created unexpected challenges for the deaf community (unexpected to the hearing community). Since the deaf community relies primarily on visual forms of communication, they are required to be able to see things like gestures in sign language, lips during lip reading, or facial expressions. Face masks and coverings impede their ability to see half the face of anyone wearing one, making it more difficult to recognize facial expressions. Facial expressions provide context cues that gestures and sign language cannot. If lip reading is necessary to communicate with a masked person, a mask covers lips, making it impossible to distinguish the movements of them. If a translator is required in some situation, limiting the number of people allowed could deprive a deaf community member of an in-person translator.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
