Due to its large population of Chinese, Malay and Indian descendents and its British colonial root, the country has four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. %0a%0aIt cultural and linguistic diversity have resulted in an informal, localized form of English known as Singlish, which is infused with many characteristics of the other languages spoken in the area. As a result, grammatical constructions of Singlish are very different from standard English.%0a%0aThe most noticeable difference is Singlish's prevalent use of functional particles at the end of a clause. The particles are borrowed from Southern Chinese dialects, most notably Hokkien. When people attach different particles to the same clause, the meaning would change. Here is a set of examples which all have the structure of "can + particle" but have different underlying meanings:%0a%0a    1. "Can meh" (Can I do this?/Can this be done? %0a    - in an unsure/doubtful tone)%0a    2. "Can lah" (Alright you can do this/this can be done %0a    - in a soft, sometimes dismissing tone)%0a    3. "Can hor" (I think I can do this/this can be done %0a    but I need your confirmation)%0a%0aMaybe as you can already tell from the above examples, in Singlish people tend to drop the subject of a sentence and we often have to infer it through the context. This is very similar to the structure of Mandarin. Here are some more examples:%0a%0a    1."Don’t want lah” (I don't want this.) %0a    2."Eh, got free time this afternoon or not?"(Do you have free time this afternoon?)%0a%0aWhile sometimes Singlish speakers drop the subject, at other times they drop the verb, especially when a sentence has the structure of "subject + be + ...". Examples are as follows:%0a%0a    1. I scared. (I am scared/I was scared. %0a    - the tense really depends on the context)%0a    2. Your drink there. (Your drink is there.)%0a    3. I eating now. (I am eating now.)%0a%0aThese are just some instances of how Singlish grammatical constructions are different from standard American English. You can learn more on the topic by going to this link: https://etoninstitute.com/blog/5-unique-features-singlish, or just google Singlish online. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210417-173604-204960#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!More Singlish Particles %0a-> - meng_s%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aTo further explore particles in Singlish, I found a video about a lady’s experience at a blind date that contains many interesting examples:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyiKxLTN9Gk%0a%0aThere were several particles used in the video:%0a%0a1.“Don’t want leh” (I don’t want this)%0a“leh” is used here to bring across a point without sounding too direct. It is worthy to note that Cynthia says “Don’t want lah” before this. Using the particle “leh” casts the sentence in a more doubtful tone than “lah”, which suggests Cynthia is becoming more open to the idea of a blind date.%0a%0a2.“You think you still very young ah?” (Do you think that you’re still very young?)%0aIn this context, “ah” is used at the end of a question, to which the asker expects agreement. Cynthia’s friend is expecting her to agree that she is no longer young and should try out the blind date.%0a%0a3.“One more lah” and “Okay lah okay lah”%0aInterestingly, “lah” has two different meanings in the two sentences above. In the first sentence, the usage of “lah” is an appeal for understanding and it makes the tone of the sentence softer. This is similar to the example of “Can lah” in the article above. In the second sentence, “lah” conveys exasperation. This suggests Cynthia is agreeing to a blind date, albeit reluctantly. In general, “lah” is a highly flexible particle that has a variety of meanings in different contexts.%0a%0a4.“siao liao” (I must have gone crazy)%0a“liao” functions as a perfective aspect marker. It carries the meaning that something has happened/been done and it is loosely equivalent to “already” in Standardized American English.%0a%0a5.“dabao lor” (You can just bring packed food prepared at home)%0a“lor” is used to signal that something is obvious. In this case, Cynthia feels that it should be obvious that Robert would bring food from home to eat at work, rather than buy food from stores outside.%0aNote: “dabao” usually means order takeout from a restaurant or store, but it refers to bringing food prepared at home in this case.%0a%0aParticles in Singlish allow for a significant amount of flexibility in their usage and often take on completely different meanings in different contexts. However, I hope that the examples from the video and those in the article have provided insight into how particles change the tone of the sentence. It is a really interesting dialect and if you’re interested to know more, here’s an excerpt of Frozen dubbed in Singlish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R95jE59WHik%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210417-173604-204960#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210506-113127-580630#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-06.05.2021 - 04:31-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210506-113127-580630 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!xiranw%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Singlish in texting'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aWhen texting a Singaporean friend, I noticed he tends to drop the be verb in texts (e.x.
