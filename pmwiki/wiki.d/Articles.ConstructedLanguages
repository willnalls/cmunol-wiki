Constructed languages may be a-priori or a-posteriori, depending on the extent to which it is based on existing natlangs, and can be used as an international auxiliary language, a language for a fictional world, or as an artistic piece of its own.%0a%0aPerhaps the most widely known conlang designed as an auxiliary language is Esperanto, designed by L.L. Zamenhof in the 1870s to facilitate communication in a linguistically diverse region of Poland. Estimates of the number of Esperanto speakers range from a few hundred thousand to over 2 million, making it by far the most widely-spoken constructed language. Another language intended for international communication is Lojban, which was designed to be culturally neutral (compared to the highly Euro-centric Esperanto) and to accurately express both logical expressions and a range of emotions and attitudes. Because of its highly regular syntax, Lojban has also been suggested for use as a programming language or machine interface language.%0a%0aThe most widely-known constructed languages overall tend to come from fictional media, rather than attempts to make an international auxiliary language: Klingon from Star Trek, Dothraki from Game of Thrones, and the likes of Quenya and Sindarin from the Lord of the Rings series to name a few. These languages tend to be a-priori, so everything from phonology, to morphology, to syntax is developed from scratch by the creators. As a result, creators have quite a bit of liberty to design a language that fits with the culture of the fictional speakers: Tolkien, for instance, used more guttural consonants in Orkish and more vowels and liquids in Quenya to make use of sound symbolism, and Marc Okrand, the creator of Klingon, used both sound symbolism and a word order that is rare cross-linguistically (namely OVS) to make the language sound more alien. Though they are often more widely recognized, these languages have very few real-world speakers, with no more than a few thousand total speakers and far fewer fluent speakers.%0a%0aOther languages are created for artistic or philosophical purposes. Toki Pona, for instance, is designed for simplicity through minimalism: it has a simple phonotactic structure, a limited vocabulary, and an analytic structure. Since the creator had no intention of making a ligua franca, Toki Pona is more of an artistic project than an auxiliary language. Ithkuil is similarly philosophical, but uses an intricate system of morphemes that represent conceptual categories to concisely express complex philosophical concepts. In addition to serious philosophical and artistic languages, there are also a number of joke languages, perhaps the most notorious being kay(f)bop(t). Kay(f)bop(t) has a variety of intentionally unwieldy features, such as phonemic hats, declining nouns by market value and manner of death, and conjugating verbs by speaker's mental state and how much they are lying; these and many other features came from attempting to implement as many "bad conlanging ideas" as possible.%0a%0aSources:%0a%0aGeneral Information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language%0a%0aEsperanto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto%0a%0aLojban: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban%0a%0aKlingon: https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-history/%0a%0aTolkien's sound symbolism: https://zompist.com/kitlong.html#lexicon (in the subsection entitled "Sound Symbolism")%0a%0aToki Pona: http://tokipona.net/tp/%0a%0aIthkuil: http://www.ithkuil.net/00_intro.html%0a%0aKay(f)bop(t): https://crazyninjageeks.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/introduction-to-kayfdanfsantaptvlirtsangbesputvombngagtvlimpkayfsnafkayfgaf-boptvegpdaffshofbompvlimpgafvlimpgaf/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-024622-679670#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Another Example %0a-> - gabrielz%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aIt's been a while since I saw this, but I was reminded of the series of videos by Artifexian on YouTube, in which he creates his own conlang Oa.%0ahttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLduA6tsl3gygfiWmGAhhHb4-HAqP6I63l%0aThe author has likely already seen this, but for anyone else reading this that finds the subject interesting, he goes fairly in-depth into many of the details required to put together a language and make it feel real.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-024622-679670#%0a#foxbegin 210508-040520-345090#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Other Constructed Language Types %0a-> - lauray%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aOther types of constructed languages also seem quite interesting.

Ithkuil is similarly philosophical, but uses an intricate system of morphemes that represent conceptual categories to concisely express complex philosophical concepts. In addition to serious philosophical and artistic languages, there are also a number of joke languages, perhaps the most notorious being kay(f)bop(t). Kay(f)bop(t) has a variety of intentionally unwieldy features, such as phonemic hats, declining nouns by market value and manner of death, and conjugating verbs by speaker's mental state and how much they are lying; these and many other features came from attempting to implement as many "bad conlanging ideas" as possible.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sources:%0a%3c General Information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language%0a%3c Esperanto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto%0a%3c Lojban: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban%0a%3c Klingon: https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-history/%0a%3c Tolkien's sound symbolism: https://zompist.com/kitlong.html#lexicon (in the subsection entitled "Sound Symbolism")%0a%3c Toki Pona: http://tokipona.net/tp/%0a%3c Ithkuil: http://www.ithkuil.net/00_intro.html%0a%3c Kay(f)bop(t): https://crazyninjageeks.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/introduction-to-kayfdanfsantaptvlirtsangbesputvombngagtvlimpkayfsnafkayfgaf-boptvegpdaffshofbompvlimpgafvlimpgaf/%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#contentends]]%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expansions:%0a%3c [[#expansions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#expansionsend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:else:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Comments%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:section: C:)%0a%3c (:Category: Varia:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
