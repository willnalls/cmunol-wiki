We can generally identify “vowel” sounds by looking at the middle of a syllable. One way to find the number of vowels is by keeping track of all the words you can make where the consonants stay the same and only the vowel differs (for example, seat, sit, soot). On the WALS map, inventory size is divided into three categories: small (2-4 vowel qualities), average (5-6), and large (7-14). %0a%0aEnglish has a large vowel inventory. It is one of two languages which has 13 vowel sounds in its inventory. Only Germany, with 14 vowel qualities, has more. Around a third of languages have large vowel inventories. Malagasy has a small vowel quality inventory (it has between 2 and 4). Only around 16%25 of languages have small vowel quality inventories. %0a%0aI found it interesting that Malagasy has a large consonant inventory while English has an average one, yet Malagasy’s vowel inventory is much smaller than that of English. I wonder if there is any relationship between the size of the consonant and vowel inventory of a given language. Is there generally an inverse relationship or is that only the case when comparing English and Malagasy? %0a%0aSources: https://phoible.org/inventories/view/31#tipa%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/2A#2/19.3/152.8%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/160#tipa%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
