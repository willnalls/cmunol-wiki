The specific names of treaties are not mentioned on their website, but they said that the Europeans violated it and forces them to migrate northward to today’s Ontario, CA, and establish new communities. %0a%0aThough greatly endangered, their language, Lunaape, is preserved. In nowadays Lenape community, there are a Delaware Nation Early Learning Center which provides instructions for the Lenape language. Also, there are day school programs with “play-based learning” environment. Aside from that, many works for their language preservation have been done in academia. For example, one scholar built a website containing formalized grammatical instructions for their language, which keeps updating until now. Unfortunately, on those indigenous people’s website, it does not seem to give sufficient descriptions of how they use their language in daily life; quantitative data is missing as well. %0a%0aSource: %0ahttp://delawarenation.on.ca/%0ahttp://munseedelaware.com/%0ahttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ridgetown-teacher-lunaapeew-language-1.5395600%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
