Rules and products are often made and only redesigned after concerns about accessibility are raised. The same is true about COVID-19 mitigation policies. Because of COVID-19, many new rules have been implemented to try to limit the spread of the virus. People have been encouraged to wear face masks and coverings as much as possible, and limits have been placed on the number of people allowed to gather in indoor spaces. These virus mitigation rules have created unexpected challenges for the deaf community (unexpected to the hearing community). Since the deaf community relies primarily on visual forms of communication, they are required to be able to see things like gestures in sign language, lips during lip reading, or facial expressions. Face masks and coverings impede their ability to see half the face of anyone wearing one, making it more difficult to recognize facial expressions. Facial expressions provide context cues that gestures and sign language cannot. If lip reading is necessary to communicate with a masked person, a mask covers lips, making it impossible to distinguish the movements of them. If a translator is required in some situation, limiting the number of people allowed could deprive a deaf community member of an in-person translator.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210430-233800-772520#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Resources for the Deaf Community %0a-> - khushiw%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aBefore reading this article, I was entirely unaware of the impact that COVID-19 had on the deaf community.

The deaf community needs to be better catered to, and hopefully after a year of the pandemic, they have more opportunities for communication.%0a%0aSource: https://www.nationaldeafcenter.org/covid-19-information%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210430-233800-772520#%0a#foxbegin 210503-193847-842230#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Non-manual markers %0a-> - leah_w%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe article cited below is all about the acquisition of sign language. One big part of sign language is non-manual markers which includes facial expressions. You brought up a good point about how covid can impart sign language. More specifically, the use of face masks hides facial expressions that people make when expressing language. More than just providing context, facial expressions is a part of sign language, meaning without the use of facial expressions, people may not be able to communicate with each other. In addition, children are not able to fully master non-manual markers such as facial expressions until 12 years of age (even though they start using them at 2 years of age). This means that children may develop the language at a slower rate if they cannot see the facial expressions others are making. %0a%0aSource:%0aMayberry, R. I., & Squires, B. (2006).

I honestly had never thought about how the deaf community would be affected by facial coverings as I do not know any deaf people but what you describe totally makes sense. I found an article on WebMD (link below) that describes how deaf people are the “forgotten victims” of the Covid-19 pandemic. Facial coverings pose a massive barrier to effective communication for members of the deaf community, but there were rarely, if ever, stories about this in the major media outlets. One proposed solution in the article that I read was to wear a clear mask called, Safe’N’Clear, so that the speakers’ lips and facial expressions are visible. Along this same line of thought I would imagine that the clear face shield that some NFL coaches, such as Andy Reid, wore would also help with the problem of not being able to read lips or see facial expressions.%0a%0aArticle: https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200722/covids-forgotten-victims-the-deaf-community %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210505-030101-958810#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210505-212348-334310#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-05.05.2021 - 14:23-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210505-212348-334310 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!MindeeL%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aOnce at the grocery store I saw a cashier using one of those clear masks that lets people see their mouths which is pretty cool.
