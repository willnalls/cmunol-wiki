Depending on the region affected in the brain, there are different consequences to the language perception ability of the individual. %0a%0aWernickes Aphasia involves lesions in Wernicke’s area of the brain (Temporal Lobe), which is responsible for speech comprehension (1). It is characterized with poor auditory processing, poor repetition, and fluent speech (3). For these reasons, it is often referred to as fluent aphasia, as speakers typically use long sentences, however the words don’t make grammatical/syntactical sense or are often made up (circumlocutions – the excessive use of words). (1) What’s interesting about WA is the speaker’s inability to recognize their own comprehension errors, and make treatment of Aphasia extremely difficult for both patient and treater. Many studies attempt to understand the language/syntax processing of different Aphasias (Wernicke’s Aphasia is usually studied alongside Broca’s Aphasia), with studies of passive sentence comprehension, and phonological comprehension (where thinking “cook” may result in saying minimal pairs like “pook” and “took”). %0a%0aThe link below demonstrates how a Wernicke's Aphasia patient speaks. As you can see, there is no grammatical sense that is made from the sentence, but also no recognition of it by the patient. %0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oef68YabD0%0a%0aThere is also interesting studies of malaproposims in paraphasia (the inability to say words that you intend to say) do explore this topic of "linguistic creativity," and how the change in words/phoneme within a word change the meaning. %0a%0a%0a1) https://www.britannica.com/science/Wernicke-area%0a2) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3034248/%0a3) https://brain-language.yale.edu/aphasia-type/wernickes-aphasia%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221204-222314-279820#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Other Types of Aphasia %0a-> - johnternullo%0a-> [-04.12.2022 - 14:23-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221204-222314-279820 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aWernicke's aphasia, discussed in the article, involves production of incoherent sentences that sound fluent, and the speaker often does not recognize the incoherency of the sentences.%0a%0aPeople with Broca's aphasia may struggle to form longer sentences and can struggle to recall vocabulary.

It is one way people lose language ability. Usually, language ability is an accumulative process, but aphasia is a reversed one. It gives researchers an opportunity to reflect on the acquisition language ability for kids. I heard from a linguistic doctor that the process of losing ability to articulate a sound is relevant to the reversed process of learning how to speak for kids. For example, kids learn to pronounce stops easily, possibly due to human anatomy, so aphasia patients tend to preserve the ability to articulate stops. However, for sounds like fricatives, which kids struggle to learn, are easily “forgotten” by aphasia patients. This relation suggests there is an universal rule of language acquisition and language loss. I believe relevant research haven’t come to a solid conclusion so there is little relevant source online, but there is one article that mentioned both aphasia and development of child language (https://academic.oup.com/book/9725/chapter/156904825).%0a%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221208-191756-286580#%0a#foxbegin 221210-003130-111820#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Communicating with people with aphasia %0a-> - dennyy%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 16:31-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-003130-111820 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThere are several useful tips to keep in mind if you ever meet someone with some form of aphasia. You should try to accommodate them and include them in conversations. For example, making sure that you have their attention and reducing background noise can help facilitate communication. Asking some yes/no questions to make sure that you both understand each other also helps. You should also use simpler words and sentences, emphasize important words/phrases, and talk more slowly. However, do not do things that belittle them. If you are speaking to an adult, simpler speech is not the same as speaking to them as if they were a child; after all, they are still an adult who can think and act independently, even if they have trouble communicating.%0a%0ahttps://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/communication-tips/%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221210-003130-111820#%0a#foxbegin 221210-042636-56270#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Characteristics of different types of aphasia %0a-> - ssbisht%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 20:26-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-042636-56270 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI found it interesting how Wernicke's aphasia differs from other types of aphasia.
