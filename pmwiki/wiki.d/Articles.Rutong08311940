In his speech "The Internet, Youth Deviance and the Problem of Juvenoia"(1), Kindelhor discussed if the Internet is related to teens and young adults' bad behaviors, and the word "juvenoia" is defined as "the fear or hostility directed by an older generation toward a younger one, or toward youth culture in general"(2). Basically, it describes a situation when the previous generation (adults and the older) hold doubts and fears towards the succeeding generation, believing that the youth are inferior and each generation just gets worse.

One case triggered by "juvenoia" is heatedly discussed and published on Time(5). Moreover, multiple scientific/sociological studies researched on the "juvenoia" phenomenon and its backgrounds, trying to find evidence for the debate over this issue (6). All these scientists, sociologists, and psychologists, as well as their research, confirmed the importance of "juvenoia", which justifies the word to be officially accepted. %0a%0aAlthough I can't say for sure about the "sustainability" of this word, we still have reasons to believe in its longevity.

Recalling back, almost every generation was concerned about something that they thought would "contaminate" the next generation. Before the Internet, it was TV; even paper books were regarded as evil centuries before. The fear and uncertainty of novel things directly lead to the fear of the new generation being less successful. However, innovation will never stop, so as this fear. %0a%0aGiven that "juvenoia" has a meaning, is widely used, and seems to survive the time, it is reasonable to add "juvenoia" into OED. %0a%0asources: %0a(1) "The Internet, Youth Deviance and the Problem of Juvenoia" by David Finkelhor. video link: https://vimeo.com/16900027%0a(2)wikidictionary https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juvenoia%0a(3)urban dictionary https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=juvenoia%0a(4)"Juvenoia" album by Druggist https://open.spotify.com/album/2pwgL9KdnNhq6f5Hs4pesD%0a(5)"What's Really Wrong With Young People Today: Juvenoia" by Chris Ferguson%0ahttps://time.com/19818/whats-really-wrong-with-young-people-today-juvenoia/%0a(6)"Juvenoia: The kids are all right, even on the Internet" by Anne Collier%0ahttps://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/Modern-Parenthood/2013/0723/Juvenoia-The-kids-are-all-right-even-on-the-Internet%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: FunWithWords:)%0a(:Title: Juvenoia:)
