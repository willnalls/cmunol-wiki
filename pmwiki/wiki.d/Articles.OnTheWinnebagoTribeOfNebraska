I choose this place because I’ve been to Chicago once and drove past their territory, but I didn’t notice the tribe at that time, so I’ve decided to take a closer look at it.%0a%0aThe traditional stewards of this land were the Winnebago [wʌnəˈbeɪgoʊ] Tribe. It belongs to a larger tribe called “Ho-Chunk.” In the 1620s the Winnebago fought a tribal war with the Potawatomis'. After this war, smallpox and measles epidemics reduced the population of the Tribe from about 25,000 people to only about 150 people, after which the population slowly recovered. The Winnebago signed their first treaty with the United States in 1816 and signed boundary and cession treaties in the 1820s and 1830s. These treaties resulted in the loss of most of the tribal land. The General Allotment Act of 1887 further reduced the area of the Reservation by about two-thirds. %0a%0aTheir language, Hoocąk, almost went extinct a few decades ago, but in recent years there has been a lot of reclamation efforts underway. They established an organization called Hoocąk Waaziija Haci (Hoocąk Language Division), dedicated to ensuring that Hoocąk continues to be a living language. The organization has created several programs such as Language Apprenticeship Program, Hoocąk Academy to teach the language. There are also interactive games, YouTube videos, and an iOS app for non-indigenous people to study their language.  Hoocąk is still in use by people today, but I didn’t find information regarding how it is used. There are about 1100 members in the tribe, but it seems like the language is spoken primarily among the elderly but less among children and young people.%0a%0aOn the tribe’s Wikipedia page, its culture is depicted with some oversimplification. It says the tribe “were known to hunt, farm and gather food from local sources, including nuts, berries, roots, and edible leaves,” and that “both genders had a role in making the best use of resources.” But on Winnebago’s official website, the culture and customs of their tribe are described in much greater detail. They have their own clothing, dance, songs, and festivals such as the Annual Homecoming Celebration, not just the nomadic, hunting culture. The description of the Hoocąk language is not much different from that on the tribe’s official website but slightly less detailed. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho-Chunk#Land_claims%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnebago_Tribe_of_Nebraska#Notable_tribal_members%0ahttps://www.hoocak.org/%0ahttp://www.winnebagotribe.com/index.php/about-us/tribal-history%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIsT207S9iCdPpwxbNWqJ4Q?view_as=subscriber%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210403-052213-155420#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Hoocąk reclamation efforts  %0a-> - roochis%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a%0aWith about 50 speakers spread throughout the northern United States and Canada, Hoocąk is an extremely endangered language.

The Language Apprenticeship program is a special reclamation program started by and for the Hoocąk community. Through this program, apprentices are paired with a speaker, who they spend up to two years with (every weekday, seven hours a day) learning the language. After they complete their Apprenticeship, they become a Hoocąk instructor for children attending Hoocąk High Schools and other adults. Betancurt characterized this Language Apprenticeship program as the bridge between the  elder Hoocąk community, who learned Hoocąk as a first language, and younger generations. %0a%0a%0aSource: https://www.neh.gov/article/reviving-ho-chunk%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210403-052213-155420#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221658-135870#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221658-135870#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
