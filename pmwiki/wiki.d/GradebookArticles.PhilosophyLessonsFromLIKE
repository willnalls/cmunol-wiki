First learned from daily speech with family and further solidified in more formal learning settings. In its most basic form, the concept centers on the quality of similarity. This is unsurprising; as with many cultures, many objects and ideas accepted in Nacirema culture were first learned by describing their relative significance to the Nacirema people as well as their affinity towards something. In the past few decades, though the concept already existed prior, there has greater emphasis on "like" as a noun and a verb as a form of affirmation. Coupled with the rise of individualism, younger Naciremans see a greater need to affirm their importance in the booming Nacirema society.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
