The primary motivation behind the usage of filler sounds is to signal intention of thought to the recipient of speech while pausing. When the filler word or sound is used and conveyed in this manner, the recipient of the speech is aware that the speaker intends to continue speaking and behaves as such. In Standard American English, the use of filler words occurs and is expressed primarily in the form of "ah" (/ʌ/) or "um" (/ʌm/), with occasional uses of "er" (/ɜː/).%0a%0aFrom analysis of filler words across languages, it can be seen that filler words are not just arbitrary verbal expressions of intent, and have distinct patterns of expression which vary across languages and populations. For example, one cultural distinction of filler language between members of the same population occurs in Standard American English, where younger SAE speaking members will use filler words such as “like” or “okay”, whereas older speakers will use filler sounds. Filler words and sounds also follow various patterns in their usage.%0a%0aThe use of filler words and sounds also has a psychological component, in which the recipient of speech is primed towards certain objects of notice through the use of a filler word or sound. A study which analyzed recipient behavior towards filler words and sounds found that listeners of speech will automatically keep track of filler words and sounds as a primer for where to focus attention. For example, if the filler word appears before a common object in the conversation, listeners would automatically gaze towards the object when the filler word was used by the speaker. Additionally, listeners would adapt to different speakers, and the psychological priming component was dependent on high or low frequency words, as well as the disfluency of the speaker as a determiner of whether to track attention after the use of a filler word. %0a%0ahttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190306100641.htm%0a%0ahttps://blogs.transparent.com/english/um-uh-mm-and-the-use-of-filler-sounds-and-words/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210509-024912-651180#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Filler words in Mandarin and its unfortunate pronunciation %0a-> - Simon_Y%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aJust wanted to add an example of a filler word in Mandarin.%0a%0a"那个" is a filler word in Mandarin, roughly translate to "that".
