A finsta is usually for close friends and a place for memes or inside jokes. %0a%0aFinsta is not in the Oxford English dictionary (2), but it is a common slang term. On Urban Dictionary, there are many similar definitions of finsta, dating back to 2015. There are a couple other meanings of finsta, but they are all from several years before 2015 and none of them are repeated enough to be a convincingly solid definition. Finsta is also on wiktionary.org (3), with the same meaning of a fake Instagram account, and citations dating back to 2017. It is also, of course, commonly used on Instagram (4), with over 160,000 posts tagged #finstagram and over 260,000 tagged #finsta, and thousands of accounts with "so-and-so's finsta" in the account bio. %0a%0aAccording to lexicographer Kory Stamper (5), the three main criteria for a word to be added to the dictionary are widespread written use, sustained use, and a defined meaning. Looking at the word finsta, the word seems to satisfy these conditions, for the most part. It certainly has widespread written use and a defined meaning. As to sustained use, it is a little harder to tell. The word has been in use since at least 2015, which is seven years; however, this is not that long, and it could be that the word might die out, especially if Instagram usage declines in the future. %0a%0aAnother thing worth mentioning is that the word "Instagram" itself is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary. Other social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and the word "Youtuber" are in the Oxford English Dictionary, however, so this seems to be just a matter of time, since Instagram is younger than these other platforms. %0a%0aTaking this into account, I think that finsta has a good chance of getting into the Oxford English Dictionary. It has widespread usage and is a well-known slang word. However, it will probably take quite some time, since Instagram must first be admitted into the dictionary.%0a%0a%0aCitations%0a1.
