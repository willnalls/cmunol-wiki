These languages are mainly spoken in Mordovia, where the Mordvin people live. The Mordvin are split into two main ethnic groups: the Erzya and the Moksha. The languages of the Erzya and Moksha (the Mordvinic languages) are very different, so Russian has become a sort of common ground language between the two ethnic groups. Due to this, the knowledge of both languages has slowly been dying out. %0a%0aThere has been much effort from the Mordvins to pass legislation in attempts to preserve their language. For instance, At the Third Congress of the Mordvin People in 1999, there was a push to promote the study of Mordvinic languages in schools, however this was never actualized. This is one of the main causal factors for the endangerment of these languages: the fact that they are no longer taught in schools. Between this and the country’s national language being Russian, there is virtually no avenue for young children to learn the Mordvinic languages, and if this continues, the languages will slowly die out. %0a%0aCurrently, there are revitalization efforts as journalists make appeals regarding formal education of the languages to Vladimir Putin, whose responsibility as head of state is to “conduct a dialogue between representatives of different ethnic groups and religions.” If accepted, this could mean schools in this region will be required to teach Mordvinic languages, allowing for some hope that these languages will not be forgotten. %0a%0aSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/1078419.html%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
