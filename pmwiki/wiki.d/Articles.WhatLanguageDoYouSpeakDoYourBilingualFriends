I think this happens because the high school I went to was in Beijing, but the language of instruction was English. As a result, at most all the students there is English/Mandarin bilingual. Between students, we would speak a mixture of both languages, even mid-sentence. We would often say a sentence that is majorly one language, but with some parts(nouns/verb) replaced by vocabulary from the other language. I'm curious if this happens in other languages too.
