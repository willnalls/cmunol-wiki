Tonal languages are languages in which different meanings can be created through using different tones of voice. Although speakers of all languages often change their tone to indicate emotion, emphasis on a certain subject, or to differentiate between questions and statements this is considered intonation and is not the same as tone. In tonal languages tone actually serves to distinguish words from one another. %0a%0aThe English language has no tone system whereas the Latvian language employs a simple tone system with three tones called the level tone, the broken tone and the falling tone.  Latvian has what is considered a simple tone system because only long syllables and diphthong can have a tone which contrasts complex tonal languages in which every syllable receives a tone. Additionally, this contrasts English in which tone does not affect the meaning of words at all. A common example of the use of tone in Latvian is the word “Zāle”. When the ‘a’ is spoken with a falling tone, the word means grass. If a level tone is used, zāle means hall. Finally, zāles, spoken with a broken tone, means drugs. %0a%0aOne question I am curious about is the relationship between intonation and tone in languages. For instance, how does intonation in Latvian differ from English and is this related in any way to Latvian being a tonal language and English being a non tonal language?  %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts%0a:Title: The Tone System: Comparing English and Latvian %0a:Author: MindeeL%0a:Section: CC%0a:Completed: 20.02.2021 - 06:54%0a:Status: complete%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aEnglish has no tonal system.
