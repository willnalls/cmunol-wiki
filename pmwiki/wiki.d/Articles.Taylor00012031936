It’s no surprise that this conference offers a wide range of accommodations for attendees that communicate primarily through signed languages (SLs). For example, the most recent conference, TISLR14, was held in Osaka, Japan, and used Japanese Sign Language (JSL), American Sign Language (ASL), International Sign Language (IS), and English as its official languages [2]. Why then is there an online movement (#NoTalkTISLR) pushing for future iterations of this conference to be in an entirely non-spoken format? %0a(For this next section, I’m assuming that these Twitter users are not lying about themselves in their bios, which is hopefully a valid assumption over on the Linguistics side of Twitter.)%0aOne user, a deaf PhD student at Leiden University [3], was excluded from some poster discussions, as many researchers chose to speak when communicating their findings with other speaking peers, even though the conference was about SLs [4]. Another user, an associate professor at the University of Bergen [5], posted a large thread on the topic of #NoTalkTISLR, arguing that future iterations of the conference should “leave talking at the door” [6]. While some might argue that it’s excluding those that cannot use or understand signed languages, he argues that it’s “encouraging everyone to negotiate an inclusive communication. It's sign language research, we *need* to sign. No exceptions” [6]. Additionally, he raises another point regarding the usage of IS vs ASL, relating it to how English, as the default language of academia, already serves as a large barrier to entry. Finally, a Linguist at the University of the West Indies [7] further supports this point, stating that “English is currently a barrier to many” and “it would shift things in interesting and productive ways” [8].%0a	I was unable to provide any information on TISLR 15 and if it will implement any sort of no-talking policies.%0a%0a%0a[1] - www.tislr2022.jp/abouttislr/%0a[2] - www.tislr2022.jp/%0a[3] - https://twitter.com/marta_morgado%0a[4] - https://twitter.com/marta_morgado/status/1575413327051759616%0a[5] -https://twitter.com/c_borstell%0a[6] - https://twitter.com/c_borstell/status/1178221219696517125%0a[7] - https://twitter.com/benbraithwaite%0a[8] - https://twitter.com/benbraithwaite/status/1575870296820748288%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: SignLanguage:)%0a(:Title: #NoTalkTislr:)
