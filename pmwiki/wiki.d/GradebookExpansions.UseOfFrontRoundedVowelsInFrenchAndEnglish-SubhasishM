As expected for speakers of American English, "front rounded vowels were assimilated overwhelmingly to back American English vowels". The /œ/–/ɔ/ distinction in particular was very improved for those who were more experienced with the French language. However, interestingly, the /y/–/u/ distinction did not seem to be affected by experience. The researchers also found that the similarities in sound alone likely did not account for the distinction in French and English vowels, suggested by the differing levels of assimilation for different vowel pairs. Thus native-language sounds played a big part in discerning patterns when learning a second language.%0a%0aReference:%0ahttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677367/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
