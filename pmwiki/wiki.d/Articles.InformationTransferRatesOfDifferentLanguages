We can split this up into both the efficiency of spoken language and written language. In spoken language, some languages might have a higher average information rate per syllable, while others might have a higher syllables per second speaking speed. Written language is more difficult to analyze and quantify informational content, but different studies and sources have attempted to do this. The interesting thing to note is that languages have remarkably similar transfer speeds in both spoken and written forms.%0a%0aEven defining the information rate of language is a difficult task as noted by a team from Google in a 2014 paper [1]. A single character in English might carry significantly less meaning than a single character in Chinese, and it is hard to quantify this difference. They attempted to make a dataset of the information content in written language, also accounting for the information in other modifiers we have discussed such as the head-complement structure. Not much research was found on the information rates in different languages when reading, but some data suggests [2] that although syllable/sec and character/sec rates may vary wildly, there is much less variation in the time it takes to read a text.%0a%0aIn spoken language, a 2019 study analyzing 17 different languages found that they all share a transfer rate of about 39 bits/second [3]. Different languages were not identical, but they noted that the standard deviation of the speaking speeds and information per syllable was much higher than that of the information rate (similar to written language). %0a%0aAlthough it is difficult to draw exact conclusions, this might suggest that humans as a whole tend to a certain information transfer rate in language. There is a certain natural speed our brain can process information, and so we are much more likely to tend to language that favors that rate. Thus logically constructed languages to be much more efficient such as Ithkuil [4] might be interesting in practice, but it might be unlikely that we can process them properly in the intended manner and speed.%0a%0a%0a[1]http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/47_Paper.pdf%0a[2]https://irisreading.com/average-reading-speed-in-various-languages/%0a[3]https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw2594%0a[4]http://ithkuil.net/%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210512-170210-837320#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-12.05.2021 - 10:02-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210512-170210-837320 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!MarkC%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Japanese spoken speed vs information denisty'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aJapanese seems to have a higher syllabic rate compared to other languages to make up for its lower information density.%0a%0ahttps://www.tofugu.com/japanese/why-do-japanese-people-talk-so-fast/  %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210512-170210-837320#%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: C:)%0a(:Category: Varia:)
