The Native American tribe that occupied the territory around Houston was the Atakapa Ishak tribe. The Atakapan people are said to be a Southwest Louisiana/Southeast Texas tribe living along the Gulf of Mexico. Based on their descriptions, they are called the Ishak. The Ishak is pronounced as “ee-SHAK” or “Iʃaek” in the IPA chart, meaning “The People.” The name of their tribe can also be translated into “The Sunrise People” or “The Sunset People.” The Ishak tribe inhabited all of Southwest Louisiana/Southeast Texas even before the Europeans. This suggests that the Ishak tribe has existed for centuries and has always lived in the Southwest Louisiana/Southeast Texas region. They have participated in several major wars. The treaties related to their land are not specified in Native American sources, but based on my knowledge outside of class, they should have been involved in The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican American War. The language spoken by the Ishak is Atakapa. According to the Ishak, they are most proud of their native language Atakapa, as it is translated into English for many meaningful songs such as Christmas Carol Silent Night and Holy Night. There are still native speakers of this language, as the Atakapa-Ishak tribe still exists. Many still live in their original territory. There are still certain websites online that provide translations of the Atakapa language, such as (http://www.native-languages.org/atakapa_words.htm), but it is sporadic and used by very few people. Currently, there are no data about the number of people speaking this language because many historians commonly believe that the Ishak people went extinct. If I were to write my summary based on a non-indigenous website such as Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atakapa), I would not have known that the Ishak tribe still existed and that the Atakapa language is still spoken. The indigenous websites also introduce their language and history in a proud tone, whereas Wikipedia states facts and writes from a perspective that considers the Ishak extinct.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221203-030528-853690#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Ishakkoy Reclamation Efforts %0a-> - meturner%0a-> [-02.12.2022 - 19:05-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221203-030528-853690 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aIt appears that the preferred name for the language spoken by the Atakapa Ishak tribe is Ishakkoy, as “Atakapa” was a name not chosen by the tribe and often translated to mean “man-eater” or “cannibal".

This dictionary was designed to help new students in their study of Ishakkoy, a vital part of language revitalization. (http://www.atakapa-ishak.org/help-atakapa-reach-500-goal-create-dictionary/). This GoFundMe was fully funded and the dictionary was published, as can be seen in its Google Books page (https://books.google.com/books/about/Atakapa_Ishakkoy_Dictionary.html?id=eFpYxwEACAAJ).
