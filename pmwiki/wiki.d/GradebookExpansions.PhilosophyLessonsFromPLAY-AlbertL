However, I believe there is far deeper meaning to be extracted beyond the the simple polysemy of the word. "Play" evokes the idyllic activities and games of youth yet in a surprising turn, the Nacireman people use it not only for these activities, but also for all manners of stressful and dark situations. Ananya points out several examples such as playing it cool, playing for time, and playing it safe. This shows that the Nacireman are a light-hearted people who's worldview revolve around not taking life or their problems too seriously. Instead when the Namerican people bump into stress, they simply remind themselves of their idyllic youth to make their worries go away. We can see the same philosophy in another one of their sayings. "It means no worries, fr the rest of your days. It's our problem-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata!" This is a famous line of a story told to the children in Nacirema and you would be hard pressed to find one who did not know the phrase. The use of play is but another reflection of this Hakuna Matata.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
