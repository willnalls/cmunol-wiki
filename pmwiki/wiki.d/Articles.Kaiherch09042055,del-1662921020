It is often used at the beginning of a statement, such as "Welp, I am failing this test." It is often surrounding an unfortunate circumstance, and sometimes substitutes the word 'well', adding the p at the end. The origin has been speculated to come from the 1994 film, Dumb and Dumber.

Classified as a real word by Merriam Webster(4), there is evidence that this word could make it into the OED. It has a clear meaning, describing the feeling of someone not sure what to do. It presents frustration or hopelessness within a sentence. Although data shows the word has not been extensively used for a long period of time (3), it can be argued that this is because it is used in more casual conversation. You would not use the term 'welp' in a standard google search, but it has been consistently more used online. Apps such as twitter, snapchat, and TikTok house the word as users describe their current states. Social media creates new slang used everyday, and 'welp' will continue to be used as an interjection just as it has the past 10 years. The clear meaning, widespread use and sustainability can all be reason to believe this word should be added to the OED.%0a%0aSources%0a1.https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Welp%0a2.https://slate.com/culture/2012/11/welp-slang-term-has-longer-history-than-you-might-think%0a3. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=welp&geo=US%0a4. https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/welp-meaning%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: FunWithWords:)%0a(:Title: Welp:)
