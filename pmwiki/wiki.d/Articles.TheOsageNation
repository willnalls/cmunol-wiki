I chose the Osage because I grew up in Pittsburgh and have never heard of the Osage. The term Osage, pronounced /oʊseɪdʒ/ (and not /oʊsa'ge/) is a French term that comes from the translation of the term Osage call themselves, "People of the Middle Waters", or in Osage, 𐓁𐓣 𐓂𐓤𐓘𐓯𐓤𐓘͘ /niu'konska/. Though the term is foreign, Osage is the preferred term.%0a%0aThe Osage Nation is associated primarily with plains Indians, so American westward expansion started to cause conflict in the early 1800s. The Osage traveled the Trail of Tears as their traditional land was ceded into the United States, and by the 1890s, 5%25 of the original population remained, with almost all living on their Oklahoma reservation. The Osage Allotment Act of 1906 guaranteed this land and created the legally recognized reservation where most still live to this day.%0a%0aThe Osage language was slowly removed from Osage life in the early 20th century. Primary sources indicate that Osage born after 1906 had a significantly diluted experience with their native language, having to learn English in school, and those born after 1940 have little to no experience with the language, speaking English in and out of the home. As of now, there are around 15 elders and second language speakers, along with revitalization efforts starting in 2003 bringing around 300 Osage learners. %0a%0aWhen searching elsewhere on the internet about Osage, I learned that the Osage script was only created in 2006 with the intention of revitalization. Before this, Osage was written with the latin alphabet using diacritics. Evidenced in the linguistic history, there is a greater emphasis on how Osage is related to other Indian languages than I could see in Osage-owned sites. As well, on Osage owned sites, there is much more information about their current and traditional culture, while on non Indian sites there is a focus on the history, specifically the conflicts and treaties in the 19th and 20th centuries.%0a%0aSources%0ahttps://native-land.ca/maps/territories/osage/%0ahttps://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/%0ahttps://www.osagefoundation.org/%0ahttps://www.congress.gov/108/plaws/publ431/PLAW-108publ431.pdf%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_Nation%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_script%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_language%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221700-952360#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221700-952360#%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210324-062236-64870#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-23.03.2021 - 23:22-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210324-062236-64870 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!evelynC%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Revitalization of the Osage language'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aThis short news clip shows that the Osage nation is aiming to teach the Osage language in schools in attempts to revitalize the language with the younger generations.
