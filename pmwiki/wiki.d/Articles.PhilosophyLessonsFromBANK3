For example, ‘memory’, ‘money’, and ‘food’ all seem to be in a “bank” of some sort. “Banks” act as storage for things that people need to use and necessities. They have to go to banks to get both material and nonmaterial items for daily use. The Nacirema prioritize collecting and putting things into “banks,” relying on these things for various tasks. This reliance is also heavily focused on in their society. They also like to use the word “bank” to talk about nature and dirt which seems completely different from the collection idea that “bank” also seems to be about. The Nacirema is a very divided society which is split between those who care about money and those who care about nature forms. %0a%0aSource: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bank%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-003520-297670#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!OED Etymology of Bank %0a-> - SubhasishM%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe noun form of bank meaning "a mound or slope" seems to originate as a borrowing from Scandinavian, appearing more commonly in Middle English and Scottish of the 1500s (bannke, bonkke, banc in Scottish) and the OED has found examples tracing back to even before in the Middle English of the 1200s.
