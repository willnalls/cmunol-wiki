It is a language that is currently endangered with an EGIDS level of 6b-9, meaning that children will likely not learn this language (1). Before endangerment, Corsican was the official language of the island. However, due to continual french influence, the language was mostly pushed aside, now with less than 10%25 of islanders having Corsican as their first language (2). Additionally, the need for proficiency in another language also helped endanger Corsican, as there was less and less islanders who primarily only spoke Corsican, rather electing to become proficient in another language alongside Corsican. Also, the decrease in readable media that is only published in Corsican has also helped its decline as many newspapers and sites are published in French around the island (3).%0a> In efforts to preserve Corsican, it is required to be taught in most education levels, alongside the now more popular French that is taught in the island (3). A TV station also broadcasts 2 hours of Corsican programming to the island per week, keeping the residents in touch with the language.
