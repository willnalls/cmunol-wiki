On WALS, there are 3 different feature values for categorizing based on the velar nasal. The first feature value is initial velar nasal, which means that the velar nasal can be found at the start of a word such as ŋoa in Swahili. The second feature value is no initial velar nasal, which means that the velar nasal is a consonant in a language but will never be at the start of a word.

According to Wikipedia, this could be because French sometimes borrows words from other language such as English that use the velar nasal. For example, French people say the word "camping", which ends in [ŋ].
