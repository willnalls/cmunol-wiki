I have observed /s/-deletion to be regional; I have heard most Caribbean and Argentinian speakers exhibit /s/-deletion as well as some speakers from Spain, while most other speakers do not typically exhibit much /s/-deletion.%0aOne thing to note is that among speakers who exhibit /s/-deletion, I have noticed different degrees of it. Here are two interviews that I found, one with an Argentinian speaker and the second with a Puerto Rican speaker:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8bPdcb4fdw&t=398s (“lleva a los amigos con él”)%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJqhN2L2sd4&t=113s (“con los muchachos”)%0aIn the first interview, you can clearly hear the speaker (Argentinian) pronounce the ‘s’ in ‘los’ but not the ‘s’ in ‘amigos’. However, in the second interview the speaker (Puerto Rican) does not pronounce either the ‘s’ in ‘los’ or ‘muchachos.’ Given that these are nearly identical situations, it is clear that /s/-deletion is not the same across dialects, and different dialects have different rules regarding when it can and cannot occur. Furthermore, in this video:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJqhN2L2sd4&t=86s (“todas las pruebas”)%0athe speaker doesn’t pronounce any of the ‘s’ sounds, so the plurality is only given by the context. Therefore in Puerto Rican Spanish, it is not necessarily a rule that at least one of the s sounds in a plural noun phrase has to be articulated. %0aOne final note on the interview from the second and third links is that the interviewer in her opening remarks articulates all of the ‘s’ sounds, but once she begins the interview she falls into /s/-deletion just like the interviewee. The interviewer is from Cuba so I believe that /s/-deletion is a part of her native accent, so it is interesting that during the more “formal” part of the interview she articulates the /s/’s but during the conversation she drops them. While I’m not sure why she specifically chose to do this, I could potentially see this being a form of code switching. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
