For example, in Mandarin Chinese, 马 means "horse", while 妈 means "mother". Both words are pronounced using the syllable "ma", but they have different tones. %0a%0aIn particular, 马 is pronounced with what speakers call the third tone, which is when the pitch goes down, then up during pronunciation. 妈 is pronounced with the first tone, which is when the pitch remains constant throughout the syllable. Varying pitch in this way enables tonal languages to have many more meanings per syllable. It should be noted, however, that two different words in Mandarin Chinese can still sound exactly the same (including tone). %0a%0aWALS makes a further distinction within the tonal languages. Some are classified as having a simple tone system, where others have a complex tone system. Some languages with a simple tone system are classified as such because they have only two distinct tones. Other languages with a simple tone system are classified as such because the presence of tonality is disputed; some researchers attribute differences in pronunciation to tone, while others assert that it is syllable stress or length. All tonal languages not classified as simple have a complex tone system. There are four (or five, when we count the neutral tone) well-documented tones in Mandarin Chinese, so WALS classifies it as a language with a complex tone system. English, on the other hand, has no tones. %0a%0aI wonder if the presence of tones in a language makes it harder to learn for native English speakers. I grew up speaking English and Marathi, two atonal languages. I learned Spanish, another atonal language, in elementary school, and Mandarin Chinese, a tonal language, in high school. I found Spanish pronunciation much easier to grasp, mostly because of the fact that the tones in Mandarin Chinese (especially the first two of four) are difficult for my ear to distinguish. Now, in my case, this perceived disparity in difficulty could be due to the fact that it's much easier to learn a language when one is a small child than when one is a teenager. But it still makes sense that learning a language with features that one isn’t familiar with would present a greater challenge, all other things being equal. %0a%0aSources:%0a%0aIan Maddieson. 2013.
