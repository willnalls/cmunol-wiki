There are four classes of unusual consonants: clicks, labial-velar plosives, pharyngeals, and dental or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives. Clicks are non-pulmonic consonants, which means that they are plosive consonants that have a different direction of airstream. These sounds are made by making a pocket of air then releasing it. Labial-velar plosives are like two consonants pronounced at the same time. Pharyngeals are consonant sounds that are produced in the pharynx. Finally, “th” sounds are dental or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives. Al languages contain none, one, or a combination of these classes.%0a%0aWhen it comes to these uncommon consonants, the two languages differ because English contains “th” sounds (like ð and θ) and Catalan contains no uncommon consonant sounds. %0a%0aI took four years of Spanish in high school so I am a bit familiar with the language. Catalan is considered a completely different language than Spanish, although the two have some similarities. I always had thought that Catalan was a branch or version of the Spanish language.  I found it interesting to see that Spanish did in fact have “th” sounds in the language, while Catalan does not. For example, in Catalan, the c in Barcelona is pronounced like Bar-se-lona, similar to english. However, in Spanish, it is pronounced like Bar-the-lona. %0a%0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://wals.info/chapter/19%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/19A#2/19.5/152.8%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/1138%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
