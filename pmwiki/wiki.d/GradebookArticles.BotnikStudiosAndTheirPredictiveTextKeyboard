I think this effect is due to a human operator behind it, filtering and modifying the content. “‘What's generated automatically by a computer only has a transient interest for us,’ says Mankoff. "But [with Botnik], it's a person working with a computer, and adding a kind of mastery to it.” This human operator can decide what makes sense to be put in, thus generating a plausible story.%0a%0aI think it is important to recognize that this text generator’s success is exactly because it is quite bad, and that is the comedic effect. This silliness and dullness of a computer add a splash of humor into the otherwise familiar-looking writing. There is still a long way to go in generating natural-sounding speech, despite its recent advancement from deep learning. But before speech generators and perfectly mimic human speech, why not enjoy some machine-generated humor?%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
