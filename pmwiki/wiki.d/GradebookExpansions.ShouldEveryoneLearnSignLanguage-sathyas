Some of the cognitive benefits include better cognition, reading comprehension, and spatial awareness as you had listed. I am sure there are many more that are specific to learning ASL rather than any language. Knowing sign language can also be a marketable skill for many positions that would normally include verbal exchange. Occupations like nurses or doctors and sales can benefit from knowing sign language. Another key benefit is that many people get worsened or completely lose their hearing ability later in life. From the source below: "About 2 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss. The rate increases to 8.5 percent for adults aged 55 to 64. Nearly 25 percent of those aged 65 to 74 and 50 percent of those who are 75 and older have disabling hearing loss." Learning sign language can be an extreme benefit to older populations, so learning sign language at a young age when it is easiest to acquire may be worth it later in life.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
