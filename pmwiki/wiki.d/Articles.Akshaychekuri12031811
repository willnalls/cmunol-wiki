This is an example of failure to include deaf people.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aThere are many principles democracy and government should entail: equality under the law, fair trial, freedom of speech and many others. Just signed and spoken languages may differ in a number of ways, laws must be made to make sure deaf and hearing people are equal under the law. Part of this is ensuring all legal and public proceedings are accessible to people with any amount of impairment, whether this be visual, hearing, mobility or anything else. %0a%0aI would like to discuss a case from a courtroom in Tampa in 2017. A woman applied to be an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter at a police news conference and was promptly accepted by a non-ASL speaking courtroom official. The problem was she was never evaluated for proficiency in ASL and during the courtroom proceedings an onlooker who was proficient in ASL found that she was essentially signing gibberish. I found this both fascinating and alarming because 1) the courtroom official clearly deprioritized the needs of deaf individuals, and 2) the case highlights why more deaf and otherwise impaired people should be involved in government. %0a%0aAnother alarming fact about this case was that the fraudulent interpreter embezzled money from a private school meant for special needs children, including deaf children. Part of the reason she was able to get away with this scheme for many years was the vulnerable position deaf individuals are put into. This is not to say deaf people are weaker than hearing people, but rather that they are more likely to be ignored by the hearing people. Compound that with the fact that deaf people occupy disproportionately low positions of power, and their specific needs can be ignored. After all, deaf people are more likely to actually address the needs of other deaf people.%0a%0ahttps://themindhears.org/2019/07/16/under-represented-where-are-all-the-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-academics/%0a%0ahttps://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/unqualified-asl-poser-with-criminal-past-dupes-police-at-seminole-heights-killer-news-conference/%0a%0ahttps://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/investigations/fake-asl-interpreter-at-tampa-police-news-conference-served-prison-time-for-stealing-from-special-needs-kids/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221205-170657-265610#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!High Profile Occurence %0a-> - nathandeyak%0a-> [-05.12.2022 - 09:06-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221205-170657-265610 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThis phenomenon is not limited to municipal governments, either.
