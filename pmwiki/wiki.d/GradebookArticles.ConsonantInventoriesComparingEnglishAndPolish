A consonant inventory is quite literally an inventory of all consonants in a language. More specifically, it is the set of all distinct consonantal sounds in a specific language. Languages vary greatly in terms of many different factors, but the consonant inventory is one that can tell us a lot about the variety of sounds that are spoken in a language. WALS gives us 5 different values going from small to large to represent this feature. What is actually being represented by these values are the sizes of the inventories, not necessarily the content. Additionally, because these values are qualitative and not quantitative, it is important to note that languages with small consonant inventories are only small compared to other languages. These values cannot act as standalones to describe a language, but instead as tools to compare different languages. %0a %0a2. The English language, found in the UK, has a consonant inventory of an average size, while the Polish language has a large consonant inventory. PHOIBLE says that English has 24 consonants in its inventory, while Polish has 31 (7 more than English). This just means that Polish has 31 significantly distinct consonant sounds, while the English language only has 24. Polish is relatively unique, because much fewer languages are categorized as having a large consonant inventory than a smaller one. Only 57 languages have large inventories out of 563, which is only 10%25. %0a %0a3. I thought it was interesting that although Polish has more consonants than English, it has significantly fewer vowels. PHOIBLE says that English has 15 vowel sounds, while Polish has only 6 vowel sounds. It seems like a lot of the Polish words would sound similar as a result, because their main vowels are so limited, but they do have a lot of variety in terms of consonants, which could counteract that. So, I would be curious to see if there’s any scale to measure the variance in words for a language, and find out if this variance would be higher for Polish or English.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
