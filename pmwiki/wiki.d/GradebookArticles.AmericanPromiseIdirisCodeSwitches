In the video, one of the boys, Idris, explains that he is made fun of by some of the kids on his neighborhood basketball team because he "talk[s] like a white boy." %0a%0aIdris explains that he sometimes changes his dialect when in his primarily black neighborhood in order to blend in, using the example heɪjɒ̞ɔl: wʌs:ʌp for "hey y'all, what's up?" to simulate a version of African American Vernacular English. In particular, this example represents a lowering of the [ɔ] sound in y'all and consonant deletion between the final two words. Throughout the rest of the clip, he uses Standard American English.%0a%0aI chose this example, in part, because I thought it was interesting how it did not conform to our typical ideas about power dynamics in the context of linguistic discrimination. Rather than a person of privilege/power attempting to enforce the standards of their dialect on another person, it shows an example of people discriminating against another dialect because it represents a departure from what they consider normal for their community. I also wonder if it may reflect power dynamics in a different way, such as the members of his neighborhood feeling threatened that their teammate has access to different experiences and privileges than they do.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
