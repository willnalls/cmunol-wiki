In both shows, the Indian characters (Ravi and Baljeet) are portrayed as extremely nerdy overachievers who are constantly picked on, and they speak with the same heavy accent that was described in this article. This further perpetuates the stereotypes that were brought up here of Indians being intellectual but weak/socially awkward. Since both of these shows had audiences that were primarily children, they allowed these stereotypes to be ingrained into kids at a young age, and then those same stereotypes would be reinforced in shows targeted at older audiences such as the ones described in this article.
