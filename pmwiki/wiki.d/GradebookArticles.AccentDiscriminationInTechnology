With standard American English, it was able to detect "trump bulldozed fox news host showing again why he likes phone injuries" which is correct except for "injuries" (interviews).

Since there are so many variations in nonnative English speech as compared to standard American English, engineers at Google and Amazon as well as linguists working with these technologies, it is harder to train the speakers to recognize these accents. A study found a correlation between diversity in voice data and being able to understand more accents. Since the dataset is not diverse enough when it comes to nonnative English accents, the speakers were not able to recognize them.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
