There are phosphATEs, nitrATEs, and sulfATEs, many of which are inedible, even poisonous. If you have violATEd a law you are an inmATE put behind a gATE. One can make an accurATE estimATE.

The Nacireman people detest the very act they need to live, using it to describe so many negatively and potentially sinful acts, so it is natural to conclude that the Nacireman people believe living is inherently sinful and bad. Indeed we see the Nacireman people glorify "dieting" which is to eat as little as possible (some to the point of dEATh) and many bemoan that they are not strong willed-enough to diet.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
