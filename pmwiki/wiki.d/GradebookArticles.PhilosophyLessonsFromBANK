The outcome of her project was BANKing on research that she planned on conducting at a food BANK. She continued her walk and passed an emBANKment. At this point, she started to think about the logistics of her project. She needed to go to a BANK before the project went BANKrupt and take out some money to fund the project. She placed this reminder in her memory BANK for later. At that moment, a BANK of dark clouds formed overhead and she scrambled up a steep BANK to get back to her car. Thankfully, the river had been BANKed so it wouldn’t overflow. She decided to drive to the BANK. There, she talked to the BANKteller to retrieve funds, passing a BANK of ATM machines. Afterwards, she drove back home with her money fresh from the BANK.%0a%0aThe Nacirema seems to be a society that cares a lot about wealth and keeping track of things. For example, ‘memory’, ‘money’, and ‘food’ all seem to be in a “bank” of some sort. “Banks” act as storage for things that people need to use and necessities. They have to go to banks to get both material and nonmaterial items for daily use. The Nacirema prioritize collecting and putting things into “banks,” relying on these things for various tasks. This reliance is also heavily focused on in their society. They also like to use the word “bank” to talk about nature and dirt which seems completely different from the collection idea that “bank” also seems to be about. The Nacirema is a very divided society which is split between those who care about money and those who care about nature forms. %0a%0aSource: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bank%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aAnalyzing the use of the word BANK in the Nacirema Society%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aYou can go deposit your money at a BANK. If you are sure that something is going to happen you can BANK on it. Professional athletes who get paid a lot of money are said to make BANK. If you are standing on the side of the river and using your phone you can be on the BANK checking your mobile BANK account. In a game of H-O-R-S-E basketball players can shoot the ball off the backboard and call out “BANK”. When playing pool or billiards you can BANK the ball off the side of the table and into the pocket. People who donate blood do so at the blood BANK. In British English, you can build a four-cylinder locomotive for BANKING trains up the Duquesne incline. If there is a set of similar things, such as laptops, you can say that there are BANKS of laptops. In Winter when the parking lots are plowed there are large snow BANKS where the snow is piled up. Usually when the airplane takes off it BANKS in order to go in the desired direction. A synonym for depositing a sum of money into a BANK account can be referred to as “BANKING” your cash.%0a%0aIn the culture and society of the Nacirema, gathering many inanimate objects is very important. The Nacirema believe that having more of a good is better than having less. In addition, of the various definitions for the word “Bank”, many have to do with money and the accumulation of wealth. Also, there seems to be a high importance placed on games, such as H-O-R-S-E and billiards. These inferences lead me to believe that in the Nacirema society, individuals place themselves, and their own personal accumulation of wealth and objects, above that of their society. The people of the Nacirema society also appear to be very materialistic and focus heavily on collecting a vast quantity of objects.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0ashowing the polysemy of "bank"%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aI need to go to the BANK of Monday to withdraw cash.
