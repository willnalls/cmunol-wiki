Firstly, it will help to bridge a gap between the hearing and deaf communities, allowing members from both to show their appreciation for each other and their differences.  I see in many places that people in the deaf community learn to read lips and speak just to accommodate to the hearing community, but it almost never happens the other way around.  It could also prove to be very useful for people in every day life to communicate if there are people who are far away from each other, if they are eating, or if the environment around them is too loud to speak in.  It can help people with spatial and mapping skills as well as sighted cognition.  And for a lot of people, as they age they become hard of hearing, so this could also help during circumstances like these.
