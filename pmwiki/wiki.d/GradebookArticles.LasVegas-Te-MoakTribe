There are three tribes that were the traditional stewards of the place now known as Las Vegas, but I will be focusing on the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians. The tribe communicated using Shoshoni, which is composed of many dialects spoken over a vast geographical region. The name Te-Moak, pronounced /tɜmok/, means “family rope-makers” in Shoshoni. The tribe was named so, likely by other Shoshone people, because they made raw hide ropes. Furthermore, the name “Shoshone”, pronounced /ʃoʃoni/, was likely coined by white settlers in the 1820s. The Shoshone people call themselves “Newe”, pronounced /nɜwə/, which means “people”.%0a%0aThe Treaty of Ruby Valley was signed in 1863 to promote peace between the Western Shoshonis and the government. Before the treaty, white farmers were slowly taking over the land that was home to the Shoshone people. The discovery of gold in Montana also resulted in greater traffic between Montana and California, further reducing the food supplies in Shoshone land. In response, the Shoshone raided the farmers’ cattle and attacked the travelling gold miners. Hence, the treaty was signed to resolve this dispute by allowing travelers to pass through the tribe’s land, with ownership of the land still belonging to the tribe.%0a%0aToday, most Shoshone people speak English. However, there are still more than a thousand Shoshones who speak the Shoshoni language. It is not clear how the language is used today based on indigenous sources. The Wick R. Miller Collection Shoshoni Language Project (SLP) is one of the efforts to revitalize the Shoshoni language. The project strives to document the language, distribute learning materials to tribal members and train language teachers. The website contains pedagogical resources in the form of illustrated, video and audio books as well as dictionaries. %0a%0aFor my non-indigenous source, I examined Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides more detailed information on the status of the language and the proficiency of current speakers. For instance, it references Ethnologue, which “lists Shoshoni as ‘threatened’” as “many of the speakers are 50 and older”. It also states that in the early 21st century, “only several hundred to a few thousand people” were fluent while an additional thousand who are proficient. This number is higher than the one provided in the indigenous source. Moreover, an examination of another non-indigenous source, the transcript of a program from the Nevada Public Radio on the Ruby Valley treaty, revealed more detailed information surrounding the conflict. The presentation of materials in non-indigenous sources was highly informative and functional. However, they generally lacked connections to the culture and experiences of the tribe.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://shoshoniproject.utah.edu/_resources/documents/gbia-pdfs/GBIA_042.pdf%0ahttps://shoshoniproject.utah.edu/language-materials/great-basin-indian-archives/evelyn-temoke-roche-ruby-valley.php%0ahttp://www.temoaktribe.com/history.shtml%0ahttps://onlineutah.us/shoshonehistory_3.shtml%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/shoshone.htm#language%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshoni_language%0ahttps://knpr.org/knpr/2014-01/treaty-ruby-valley%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
