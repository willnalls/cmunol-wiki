In fact, this is not true at all. Although the way music comes through sign language and the way the deaf community interacts with music may be different, it is still largely present. Many would agree that music uses sound to convey feeling in ways that plainly spoken words can’t, or at least not to the same degree. The same is true for the way music is expressed in sign language, but instead of the quality of the words being changed through singing and volume, in ASL it is through rhythm and movement. By changing grammatical parameters in ASL, such as facial expression, body movement, speed, hand shape, and others, it is possible to change how the sign is perceived and convey the intangible, incaptural musical quality the same way the quality of a sung word is different from a spoken or written word and cannot be captured. The artist Christine Sun Kim gave a viral TED Talk and began an art movement dedicated to building the social currency of ASL by creating visual music with the language. %0a	Another large movement relevant to this article is sign language interpretation at concerts. At one point in time, and still in some cases, concerts and music were interpreted literally by sign language interpreters, meaning the interpreters would just sign the lyrics and do nothing else. This was bad for a number of reasons, the biggest being that what I argued earlier, the qualities of music that make it music are not the literal words but the combination of the lyrics with the qualities of being sung or rapped. Music is more than the sum of its parts, and the rhythm, emotion, and feeling that is conveyed by music was totally lost by a sterile, literal interpretation. A sign language interpreter named Amber Galloway Gallego is working to change that. She uses her movement, body language, and  facial expression, to turn the auditory performance and feeling in music into a visual one. The way she and others, like Christine, have used ASL to represent and visualize sound is fascinating and groundbreaking. %0a%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.ted.com/talks/christine_sun_kim_the_enchanting_music_of_sign_language/transcript %0ahttps://www.vox.com/videos/2017/3/27/15072526/asl-music-interpreter %0ahttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170816084905.htm %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210506-045519-619350#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Sign Language Interpreter in Concert %0a-> - shreya_r%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQMnsAE3HBA%0a%0aThis video is an example of an interpreter at a concert incorporating expressions and even dance moves into his interpretation of a Beyonce song. He discusses how for deaf people at a concert, it's difficult to watch both the performer and the interpreter at the same time, so he tries to match the performer's energy in his interpreting. The way that he expresses the song in sign language is more than just a translation; instead, he puts on an entire performance of his own that's engaging for even hearing people to watch. This provides an example of how concert interpreters can use body language and rhythm to convey not just the meaning of a song, but also the energy and emotions behind it, and give deaf concert attendees the full experience. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210506-045519-619350#%0a#foxbegin 210506-143251-427070#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!How Amber Galloway Gallegos Modifies ASL for Music %0a-> - saumyaB%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aPrior to reading this wiki article, I had never fully considered how deaf and hard of hearing people interact with music. I was curious as to how Amber Galloway Gallego modifies ASL to interpret music. The five rules ASL needs to follow are palm shape, orientation, location, movement, and non-manual markers. In order to modify this to convey instrumental music, Amber signs lower on the body for lower bass sounds and higher on the body for higher sounds. Amber also uses facial expressions, mouth shape, and hand movements to convey the vibrations of the bass. As for lyrics, Amber tries to incorporate rhyme and wordplay by switching between signs in a clever way. She also combines signs to further this wordplay. When signing Future’s “F*** Up Some Commas,” Amber signs the word for “comma,” but uses her middle finger to do so, effectively conveying the line in a way that expresses more than just the base lyrics. Since all of this is occurring live while music is actively progressing, Amber needs to shorten some of her signs to fit fast music like rap or lengthen some to fit longer held out notes.%0a%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuD2iNVMS_4&ab_channel=Vox%0ahttps://www.openculture.com/2017/04/how-ingenious-sign-language-interpreters-are-bringing-music-to-life-for-the-deaf.html%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210506-143251-427070#%0a#foxbegin 210509-020620-551640#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Rhyming In Sign Language %0a-> - BenP%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aIt seems like an important part to some music is rhyming, so I did a little research into how rhyming works in sign language.%0a%0aBasically, words in sign language, as you would expect, rhyme if they repeat certain parameters that make up words.
