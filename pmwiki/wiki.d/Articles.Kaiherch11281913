When researching neurolinguistics, I came across an article that details the brain matter of bilingual children. According to a new study by an international team of academics, bilingual participants had more grey and white matter than same-aged children who only spoke one language. In the past, bilingualism has positively affected brain structure and cognitive performance in adults, but the new study shows another language can have the same impact on developing brains in children. This is the first time there has been strong evidence for a positive effect on grey and white matter, as it has been studied in adults before. Grey matter is lost over time, but the loss was less pronounced in bilinguals. This impact can benefit language function, such as performance in attention and executive control. This was extremely interesting to me as my sisters and I were taught Tagalog at a young age, which would be different from learning the language in high school. There are countless benefits to learning another language at a young age, and this is already done in countries like China. It brings the question on whether or not the same tactic should be used in the United States. %0a%0ahttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200902095125.htm%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221202-230954-789830#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Brain matter in Bilinguals Expansion %0a-> - victorwa%0a-> [-02.12.2022 - 15:09-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221202-230954-789830 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAdding on to what you've summarized, bilingual individuals are able to ward off the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's an extra four years on average compared to monolinguals. This is due to the enhancement of the "cognitive reserve", which is a brain's ability to improvise and find alternative ways of getting a task done. By having a large enough cognitive reserve, it can offset damage that can be done to the brain from Alzheimer's and allow the human to cognitively function normally.%0a%0aSchools in the United States are already teaching languages other than English in middle and high school, but I'm not sure if all schools across the country do this. If they do, they also might not mandate that every student takes a foreign language course, and the quality of teaching may be poor, which can discourage students from continuing with learning the language in the future. Nevertheless, I think education systems should continue to push the agenda of offering foreign languages to students, as it not only benefits every student's brain development, but gives them a new experience and appreciation for cultures that aren't strictly American, especially in communities that are homogeneous.%0a%0ahttps://www.parents.com/bilingual/benefits-of-learning-a-second-language-as-a-child/%0ahttps://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-is-cognitive-reserve%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221202-230954-789830#%0a#foxbegin 221209-201610-88820#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Brain Matter in Bilinguals Expansion %0a-> - adrian%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 12:16-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-201610-88820 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAccording to a study by Pliatsikas et al. (2020), bilingualism causes changes to the brain structure due to needing to learn a lot about a new language and learning the skills required to communicate. In particular, the structural changes appear to mainly occur in the frontal cortex, which is known to deal with processing language. These frontal regions of the brain were seen to contain more grey matter for bilinguals. So the importance of this is that the brains of bilinguals and monolinguals develop differently, and having a bilingual brain may mean that it's more resistant to aging.%0a%0aPliatsikas, C., Meteyard, L., Veríssimo, J., DeLuca, V., Shattuck, K., & Ullman, M.
