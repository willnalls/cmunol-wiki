Public school are underfunded, and in particular the teachers are not trained to deal with deaf students. This is particularly true outside of Lima, Peru's capital. As a result, the experience of the deaf students in the class is vastly different to the other students. These deaf students are isolated and simply do not learn at the rate of the other students.%0a%0a%0aSince these children are not taught PSL in school, they have now developed their own rudimentary methods of communication between each other. They now have difficulty communicating with the older deaf people. Older generations of deaf people, educated through the old special education system, are fluent in PSL, and thus have formed strong PSL-speaking communities. This disconnect from the deaf community further compounds the poor education these youth receive in school and the general isolation from the rest of society. However, t should also be noted that the special education system itself also left deaf adults with poor literacy and mathematics skills, making it difficult for them to hold down jobs.%0a%0a%0aAttempts by the government to adress the problems with inclusive education have been equally disastrous. Special LSP seminars for teachers have low attendance and generally have ineffective pedagogy.
