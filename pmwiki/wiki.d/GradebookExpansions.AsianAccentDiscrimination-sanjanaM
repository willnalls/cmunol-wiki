The sheep example reminds me of a similar confusion with the Colombian accent in the show Modern Family. One of the main characters, Gloria, has a thick Colombian accent, which is often used for comedic purposes. Another character's name is Luke, and in one scene, she is telling "Luke" to "look." However, with her accent, the vowels sounded the same, and it caused a lot of confusion for Luke. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
