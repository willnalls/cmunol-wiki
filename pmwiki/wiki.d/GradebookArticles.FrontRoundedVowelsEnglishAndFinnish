The resulting sound has qualities similar both to the unrounded vowels pronounced with the tongue in the same place, and to the corresponding back rounded vowels pronounced at the same height. Front rounded vowels are not very common cross-linguistically, but are most common across northern Eurasia. Of languages that have front rounded vowels, most have both high and mid front rounded vowels, with only about ten listed languages having only one or the other.%0a%0aWhile English has a large number of vowels, only back vowels /u/, /ɔ/, and the back diphthong /oʊ/ can be rounded in English. In Finnish, however, the sounds /y/ and /ø/ are used, the former contrasting with other high vowels, unrounded /i/ and back vowel /u/, and the latter contrasting with other mid vowels, /e/ and /o/. The front-rounded vowels also appear in the diphthongs /æy/ and /øy/, which contrast with /ɑu/ and /ou/, as well as with /æi/ and /ei/.%0a%0aIt is interesting to see how the distribution of front rounded vowels is so highly concentrated in Eurasia, and it begs the question: what environments are conducive to a language evolving front rounded vowels? what environments contribute to the loss of front rounded vowels in a language? and what are the circumstances in which a language ends up with only a high front round vowel, or only a mid front round vowel?%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
