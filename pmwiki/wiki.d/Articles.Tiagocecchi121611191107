The name Quechua also refers to the indigenous Quechua peoples, who are today distributed throughout Boliva, Argentina, Ecuador and in particular Peru. This ancient language family descends from Proto-Quechua, the language spoken by the Incas prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16th century. The word Kichwa is descended from the Proto-Inca word for “people of the valley”. As a result of the conquest, the Quechua people are today not of purely indigenous ancestry, but %0a%0aI choose Quechua in particular because it counters the stereotype that indigenous languages are either extinct or on their way to extinction. While it is true that the fraction of Peruvians who speak Quechua has declined in the past 100 years, the absolute number of speakers has in fact increased. It has survived and even thrived during the process of urbanization; indeed, even as Quechua people move in greater numbers to big cities such as Lima, they and their children continue to speak their variety of Quechua. According to the Peruvian government, there are about 3.8 million people who speak Quechua as their mother language. While the language family as whole is mostly vital, certain varieties of Quechua are endangered, in particular the Amazonian Kichwa languages.

As a result, there are many names/spellings given to Quechua languages, such as Quechua, Kichwa, Kichua, Runa Simi, Runa Shimi. In particular, non-indigenous sources seem to call these sets of languages by many different names. Moreover, these sources seem to focus more on the historical relationship to the Spanish conquest and the Inca empire rather than the current vitality of the language.%0ahttps://www.kichwa.net/kichwa-shimita-rimankapak-sinchichinkapak-tantanakuy/%0ahttps://bdpi.cultura.gob.pe/lenguas/quechua%0ahttps://www.amazonteam.org/maps/sarayaku-es/%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)%0a(:Title: Quechua-Kichwa:)
