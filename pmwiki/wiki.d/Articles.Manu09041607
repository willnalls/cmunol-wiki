It is commonly used in the context of popular video games and sports, especially in basketball and soccer. The word has grown in popularity since late 2019, and has been used consistently outside of the sporting world, both on the internet and in verbal speech. While the word GOAT(in the aforementioned context) was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1992, “goated” has yet to be added itself (1). However, I believe this word has a strong case to make it as it has a clear meaning in addition to its widespread and likely sustained use.%0a%0aFirstly, goated has had a fairly consistent uptick in popularity since it was introduced into mainstream (3). This trend indicates that the word’s use is likely to continue to be used commonly. Although its use can already be considered sustained, as it has been around for many years, any remaining arguments against this point will likely be quelled with its continued use in coming years. Additionally, the word “goated” can be found in many different communities, especially online (2).Although used almost exclusively by the younger generation and internet personalities, the word is known and used quite frequently.%0a%0aWhile more time may be needed to confirm the sustained use of the word, “goated” is definitely a great candidate for induction into the Oxford English Dictionary.%0a%0a(1) https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/75887?rskey=ZrQulm&result=3&isAdvanced=false#eid1257905150%0a%0a(2) https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goated#:~:text=goated%2520(comparative%2520more%2520goated%252C%2520superlative,restaurant's%2520fries%2520are%2520absolutely%2520goated!%0a%0a(3) https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%25205-y&geo=US&q=goated,gg%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 220910-162654-95770#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Why Goated probably shouldn't be added to the Oxford English Dictionary %0a-> - justinzo%0a-> [-10.09.2022 - 09:26-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 220910-162654-95770 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAccording to google trends, the worded "Goated" has gotten much more popular within the last 2 years, becoming super prominent in April of 2021(1). As such a new word compared to most of the other words in the English Language, it is hard to judge its consistent use. Additionally as mention above and in class, having words that are only prominent among a certain demographic, in this case teens and young adults, makes it hard for us to describe it as having widespread use. Since the widespread usage and sustained usage of Goated is still currently unclear, it probably would not be added to the Dictionary.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a1)https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%25205-y&q=goated%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 220910-162654-95770#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: B:)%0a(:Category: FunWithWords:)%0a(:Title: Goated:)
