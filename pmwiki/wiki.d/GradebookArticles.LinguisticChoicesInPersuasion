One thing that I've found interesting is that, from my experience, the average person is most persuaded by dialects that most people do not use. For example, as much as politicians make efforts to relate to their average voter, the average Senator may not have the regional dialects or speech patterns of his or her state, or if he or she does, it is not so pronounced. Even in public discourse, at least historically in the United States, the general population tends to prefer hearing their news from someone who speaks in a way similar to how leaders and public figures have in the past. If not in literal pronunciation and dialect, perhaps this claim is at least true when it comes to word choice. From what I've seen, professionalism and technical language tend to be persuasive even to a person who doesn't use or understand such terms. For example, a non-technical user may be persuaded by a scientist using highly technical language because "it sounds right."%0a%0aIn the realm of politics, Trump and Fox News may well be a reasonable counter-argument against this conjecture. However, the idea that people would, in some cases, delegate responsibility for decision-making to people who are not representative of their own cultural groups (in this case, linguistic ones) is worth noting. These structural factors may be similar to those that cause Congress to be disproportionately white and male.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----
