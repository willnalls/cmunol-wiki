The only positive I could think of was if someone is performing or telling a story, the audience could eat it up.  However, I thought about eat in a slightly different way.  I think it shows a lot more about competition and asserting one's dominance over another because in nature, eating was simply that: you either ate food and survived or you were eaten.  Many of the sayings using the word eat, like "eat my words" or "eat out of my hand" show some type of power dynamic where one person is almost subservient to another.
