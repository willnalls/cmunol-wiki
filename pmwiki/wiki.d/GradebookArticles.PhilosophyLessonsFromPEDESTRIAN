"Pedestrian" has different meanings but is often used to describe someone who is walking alongside a road or on a sidewalk. "Pedestrian" additionally means that something is boring or dull. Typically, the people of the Nacirema don't like to be bored, so it is a common goal among the people to avoid "pedestrian" activities or places, instead opting for more interesting ventures. The use of the same word for these meanings shows that in Nacirema society and culture, walking in any form is seen as boring or beneath yourself, meaning that the Nacirema people would like to avoid walking at any cost. Even for Members of the Nacirema in dense urban areas, walking in any form is seen as undesirable, and many societal pushes are made to reduce infrastructure for people who walk. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
