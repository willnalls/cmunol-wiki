The article “Challenging “Extinction” through Modern Miami Language Practices” by Dr. Wesley Y. Leonard tackles the expectation that Native American languages are only long-gone aspects of a frozen past and a dead culture. This idea perpetuates erasure of Indigenous languages, or the idea that they are only meant to be talked about in past tense, as if these cultures and languages are not currently thriving and being used in both domestic and diplomatic contexts. %0a%0aHe discusses the new efforts surrounding the Miami language not as a reclamation, but as a reclamation. Revitalization is usually thought of as trying to achieve mass fluency, but Leonard is more concerned with reclaiming the language for cultural purposes. He writes, “When  we  talk  about  language  and  cultural  revitalization,  we  are  in  essence  referring  to  the  revitalization  of  belief,  value  and  knowledge  systems.  It  is  through  our  language  and  culture  that  we  express  those  ways  of  knowing.” The main focus is “breathing new life into it”, and applying it to the Miami tribe’s roles in the modern world. At cultural reclamation camps for children like eewansaapita camp, they learn basic vocabulary, a number song in myaamia, and ball games where the points are recorded in myaamia. Songs, games, and other regular communication are some of the methods being used to reclaim the Miami language and apply it to modern contexts.%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
