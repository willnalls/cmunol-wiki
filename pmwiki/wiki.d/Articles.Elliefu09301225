Uncommon consonants that WALS identifies are clicks, labial-velars, pharyngeals, ‘th’ sounds or a combination of these. Importantly for this article, we’ll look at ‘th’ sounds, of which there are 40 languages that have only this uncommon consonant and a smaller number with the ‘th’ sound and a combination of the others. The ‘th’ sound is a dental or alveolar non-sibilant consonant, denoted with the [θ] and [ð] phonetic symbols. Unlike the other uncommon consonants like clicks which commonly appear in the South African languages, the ‘th’ sound doesn’t have a particular geographical region or linguistic family that they are often associated with. %0a%0aFor our discussion, the WALS and PHOIBLE notes that the ‘th’ sound is part of English phonetic inventory and is not part of Cantonese phonetic inventory. There are a variety of reasons However, in further discussion from the WALS page on the absence of ‘th’ sounds, the fact that English does have ‘th’ whereas Cantonese doesn’t is not unusual geographically. There appears to be no geographical pattern to the presence or absence of ‘th,’ as we see that many languages near England don’t have ‘th’ whereas near the origin of Cantonese there is also the Lakkia language that does indeed have the ‘th’ sound. %0a%0aA curious aspect that I would like to note is that there is a differentiation between Cantonese and Hong Kong Cantonese in PHOIBLE. Additionally, WALS notes an interest aspect which is that the ‘th’ sound might arise from the loss of sibilant qualities from /s/ and /z/, which happens in only some varieties of Yue Chinese or Cantonese but not in Hong Kong Cantonese. I’m curious how within the language did this differentiation occur? A possibility that comes immediately to mind would be the British colonization of Hong Kong, and thus use of English, where the ‘th’ sound does appear. However, it is hard to say without additional research whether this is by causation or an unusual coincidence. %0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://wals.info/chapter/19%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/19A#2/19.3/152.9 %0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/19 %0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/2309 %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: D:)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)%0a(:Title: Uncommon Consonants: Comparing English and Cantonese :)
