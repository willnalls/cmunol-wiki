The languages have a grammatical restriction on adding a plural suffix to a noun if the noun is given a quantifier. Nominative personal pronouns can be added to give emphatic emphasis. For example "Ben Japon'um" is an emphatic "Japon'um", meaning I am Japanese,  and similar sentences with similar emphatic emphasis can be recreated in Japanese and Korean.%0a%0aSome linguists have proposed that these three languages are part of a sprachbund called Altaic.
