Now, a "girlboss" can also be a girl who is "badass all around" whether she is actually a boss or not-- or, a very negative connotation of "someone who is lauded as being a feminist icon, despite the fact that they are actually extremely unpleasant or unfeminist", from one entry on Urban Dictionary from March 2021 (1). There are now multiple entries in Urban Dictionary from 2021-2022 that have a very negative connotation to girlboss, and it is widespread across the internet, with videos like "I am a Girlboss" by Amanda McCants on YouTube portraying a girlboss as someone who is mostly show and not actually a boss or someone who commands respect through her own merit (2). Another video on YouTube by social/political commentator zoeunlimited, entitled "GIRL BOSS culture: the prettiest pink lie" explains how girlboss may not actually be a feminist label but rather have more negative anti-feminist connotations (3). It seems, then, that there are many different meanings to the word, and that they conflict with each other. This makes me think that "girlboss" may not qualify for an addition to the Oxford English Dictionary, since the meaning of a new word should be agreed upon.%0a%0a(1) Urban Dictionary: define.php.
