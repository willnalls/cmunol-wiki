She accounts a time when a girl her age pointed at her and asked "How come you talk like a white girl?" almost like an insult. In this way, she was discriminated against for not speaking like the other girls. Speaking in "white" English made it seem like she was betraying or denying her culture. Michelle Obama acknowledges this, but says that her parents planned and encouraged their kids to speak in the Standardized American dialect, as "the idea was we were to transcend, to get ourselves further". In this sense, the AAVE dialect is discriminated against in America in general. Her parents felt the need to teach their children to go against the expectations of their own community (to speak using AAVE) in order for them to succeed. Michelle Obama elaborates on this point of being stuck in between both expectations to say that after marrying Barack, she noticed that people treated him the same. %0aI think this phenomenon extends to other dialect communities as well. Indian English is another dialect that is discriminated against in the US. However, within the Indian community, speaking in American accent makes a person seem more foreign and less authentic or culturally aware. A common solution to this problem (not used by Michelle Obama) is code switching, where someone can switch the dialect or accent they are using depending on who they are speaking with. %0a %0aSource: %0aBecoming - Michelle Obama pgs 40-41%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
