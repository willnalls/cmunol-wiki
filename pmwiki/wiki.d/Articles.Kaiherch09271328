On the map English is in the United Kingdom. English has no initial velar nasal. Tagalog has an initial velar nasal. A velar nasal is a type of consonant sound that you hear in the word “ingredient”, in the english language, the “ing” can be written as ŋ. In English, there are no words that start with the velar nasal. In Tagalog however, there are words that start with the velar nasal. Ngalo, nguni, and ngiti are just a few examples. These words begin with the /ŋ/ sound, representing the initial velar nasal being present. There are no words in the English language that begin with /ŋ/, the sound only occurs within a word. There is also a feature value of no velar nasal sound, which means the /ŋ/ sound does not exist in the language at all. This occurs in the Hindi language. English and Tagalog both contain the velar nasal sound, it is just a difference of where the sound can occur. English being after initial vowel or consonants, while Tagalog the sound can be initial. My question on this is where does the difference stem from? I know that Tagolog borrowed a lot from Hispanic language, from Spanish colonialism. Did the /ŋ/ sound come from this? Is there a specific reason that English cannot start with this word, while it can be within the word? Is this rooted in the European language, which English stems from?%0a %0aSources%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/9A#1/20/152%0ahttps://phoible.org/%0ahttp://seasite2.niu.edu/beginning-tagalog-1-grammar/tagalog-sounds-consonants/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_velar_nasal#:~:text=In%2520many%2520languages%2520that%2520do,%25C9%25AAn%25CB%2588%25C9%25A1ri%25CB%2590di%25C9%2599nt%255D%2520or%2520%255B%25C9%25AA%25C5%258B%25CB%2588%25C9%25A1ri%25CB%2590di%25C9%2599nt%255D.%0a %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)%0a(:Title: The velar nasal: Comparing English and Tagalog:)
