They originally intended to go to university there and settle down, but ultimately decided to move elsewhere. The native tribe of this area of New Mexico is the Mescalero Apache tribe and this appears to be their preferred name. There are three sub-tribes of the apache tribe including Mescalero, Lipan and Chiricahua. The IPA transcription of the name is [meskəˈleɹoʊ əˈpatʃi].%0a%0aAccording to their website, this particular land area was long recognized by Spanish, Mexican, and American treaties, though specific names were not given. The Mescalero Apache reservation land was established in 1873 by the Executive Order of President Ulysses S. Grant. Since then, various sub tribes of the apaches have been consolidated  under the Mescalero apache tribe through the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act.%0a%0aThe language is a very important part of their culture and, as seen through the website, many efforts have been made to preserve and spread the language. They refer to the language as “Apache” and even set up The Mescalero Apache Tribe Language Program called Ndé Bizaa to defend and support their language and culture. The program is furthering their goals by involving local schools preschool to high school and training teachers to teach the language. They are also promoting the use of the language in all situations including social, work, and ceremonial. However, there are no statistics about the number of people who speak the language, only statements of wanting to increase the number.%0a%0aAfter searching up the Western Apache language, I noticed that the main difference between the native tribe’s website and third party sites was the type of information provided. For one, I noticed that the tribe’s website did not list the native name of the language, only “Apache Language”, but on Wikipedia, it is written as Ndee biyáti'. Additionally, on the native Mescalero Apache tribe website, most of the information provided was in the context of their culture and people and how it relates to their society. However, on Wikipedia, most of the information was about the geographical origins, phonology, and grammar. Very little was mentioned about the significance of the language in social or cultural settings. %0a%0aLinks:%0ahttps://mescaleroapachetribe.com/nde-bizaa/%0ahttps://mescaleroapachetribe.com/our-culture/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_language%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221700-761120#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221700-761120#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
