"Fried rice" sounding like "flied lice" would be one of the most representable examples. The pronunciation for "fried" would be referred to as [flaɪd] not [fraɪd], and "rice"as [laɪs] not [raɪs]. This shows Asian accented English tends to use the [l] in place of [r].    %0a%0aThis meme does not target a specific group but talks about the overall Asians who speak English, most definitely those who did not have English as their mother tongue. But if I do have to determine where this variant is from, East Asian countries like Japan, China, and Korea are the most common examples used on the internet. One of the reasons for the difficulty in pronouncing [r] maybe because [l] and the [r] sound are allophones of the same phoneme. Since their native language does not necessarily distinguish the two sounds, it would be hard to pronounce them as to how a native English speaker would do. %0a%0a%0a%0alink: https://me.me/t/flied-lice?s=new%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
