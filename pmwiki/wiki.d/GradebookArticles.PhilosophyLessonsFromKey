You can find yourself down by Key West in the Florida keys, looking for hidden treasure with a mysterious key. Made out of metal, it unlocks a chest, with planks made of wood, keyed altogether with carefully cut slots. You examine your puzzle map, with its detailed key, and check your online key-value pair to cheat with an answer key. You key in the data, on the keys of your keyboard, and search for the answer to your missing chord. You stood in the key, on one end of the court, singing out loud an anthem of sorts. And yet you were booed, for singing off key, despite standing where Google told you to be. And out you storm, underneath the maple, keys floating down, towards the car stable.
