In this article, the author discusses how Zulu and Xhosa (two closely related languages) clicking sounds are acquired by both native speakers and by English speakers. There is a section where the author goes into the intricacies of the click consonant inventories, consonant substitution, and other linguistic differences between English and Zulu which may make it difficult for an English speaker or even a native Zulu child to acquire the language. %0a %0aThe research in this article involved studying children learning to acquire click sounds as well as unusual double initial consonant sounds such as ”gq” and “gc”. They found that children substituted [d] or [g] for /gq/, [d] for /gc/, and [s] or [ts] for /ch/. Clicks were acquired as one of the last steps to fluency, and the learning process involved 4 stages: %0aStage 1 = deletion of clicks in words %0aStage 2 = simplification process (c>tand q>tandx>t/k) %0aStage 3 = click substitution (c>qandx>c/qandq>c/x) %0aStage 4 = click accompaniments materialise (ch>ncandgc>c)%0aStage 5 = acquisition of clicks %0aFor the native speaking babies, the “appearance of all basic clicks is between 1 and 1:6 years”. They also found that the babies acquired voiceless clicks first, followed by voiced and nasal clicks.%0a %0aAnother interesting thing I learned was that the clicking languages are extremely old. According to the article, clicks “seem to have been part of the first fully articulate human language that appeared among some group of early human language that appeared among some group of early humans 50,000 years ago.”%0a %0aIn another article I found, “Left-Hemisphere Advantage for Click Consonants Is Determined by Linguistic Significance and Experience” by Catherine T. Best and Robert A. Avery, the authors specifically focused on speech recognition and how left-hemisphere populations have a much higher aptitude for recognizing consonants. The theory discussed is called the LH (left-Hemisphere) advantage, and employed a study which assessed Zulu vs. English speakers’ click recognition. The English speakers auditorily recognized the clicks as non-speech sounds, but only the Zulu speakers were able to retain the sounds with linguistic significance, (for instance, having the ability to distinguish [ǂ] from [ǁ]) because their language uses clicks as consonants. In this way, the Zulus showed an LH advantage.%0a %0aArticles: %0aAcquisition of clicks study: https://perlinguam.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/81/165%0a%0aLeft-Hemisphere Advantage for Click Consonants: https://www-jstor-org.cmu.idm.oclc.org/stable/40063379?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000937-166700#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000937-166700#%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
