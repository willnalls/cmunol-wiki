I have also seen it referred to as Anishinaabemowin or Anishinaabe, but I am not sure which name is preferred. This large nation is commonly divided up into the Northern Superior Region, Lake Huron Region, Southeast Region, and Southwest Region. These regions are made up of many different tribes. The tribe who are the traditional stewards of the specific area I decided to research (Goderich) are the Saugeen Anishnaabek of the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON).%0aOne of the first treaties related to this land was the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which was meant to help protect First Nations land by stopping or at least slowing European settlements in the area. Unfortunately, this was not successful, and in 1874 a Royal Declaration had to be made to confirm that the Saugeen Peninsula was held by the Saugeen Anishnaabek and created a more distinct boundary. The Canadian government later passed additional acts to protect First Nations land; however, many of these were not upheld. Some include the Half-Mile Strip Treaty, which saw the SON sign over 4000 acres of land to be used to build a road and Treaty No. 72, which saw the loss of 500000 acres of land in exchange for the proceeds from the lands to be held in trust. Other such treaties include Treaty 45, Treaty 67, Treaty 82, and Treaty 93.%0a%0aSince the Anishinabewaki Nation is quite large, multiple different languages are spoken through different regions. The language traditionally spoken in the region I am focusing on seems to be Ojibwe. Ojibwe is not one single standardized language, and in some cases, speakers of different dialects may not be able to understand each other. From the information I was able to find, it is considered an endangered language. There is an effort to revitalize the language, especially through elders, who are often native speakers, educating younger generations. There is also an Ojibwe People's Dictionary online, which is a "searchable, talking Ojibwe-English dictionary that features the voices of Ojibwe speakers," that has been created to help revitalize and support education of the language as well as to encourage new speakers. I could not find any information about how many current speakers of the language there are.%0a%0aIf I were to write a summary of the language based on only non-Indigenous sources, specifically Wikipedia, it would definitely be clearer and more concise than what I could write from looking at Indigenous source. However, this is not necessarily a good thing. While Wikipedia did seem to include a lot of the information I found from my previous research, it also seemed to be rather simplified. Clarity and simplicity are useful to a point, but it does make me wonder how much history, intricacies of differences between tribes and regions, etc. is lost or glossed over that are important to understanding the language and the people who speak it. Information regarding treaties and culture seemed to be quite accurate, although overall, the article was much more euro-centric than any of the Indigenous sources.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://native-land.ca/maps/territories/anishinabek-%25e1%2590%258a%25e1%2593%2582%25e1%2594%2591%25e1%2593%2588%25e1%2590%25af%25e1%2592%2583/%0ahttps://www.saugeenojibwaynation.ca/%0ahttps://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
