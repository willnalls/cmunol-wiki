It’s a vowel merger (formerly called the “low back merger”) in which speakers in some English dialects do not differentiate between the vowels in minimal pairs like cot/caught, bot/bought, and pond/pawned. The IPA symbols for these low back vowels are /ɑ/ and /ɔ/ (we use /ʌ/ in this class), but more interestingly, this merger is not uniformly distributed across North America. Regions like the “South”, the “Inland North”, and the “Northeast Corridor” (we’re not going to get into the specifics of where exactly these are, but you probably have good enough ideas in your head) seem to resist this merger most strongly. Thus, if you exhibit this merger, it’s likely that you’re from one of these regions (or linguistically influenced in some way by people/media from there).%0a%0aBut how can we figure out someone’s location with this information?
