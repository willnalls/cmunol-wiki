The article discusses how Rachel's use of AAVE (African American Vernacular English), leads her to be misunderstood and even prejudged. Situations like this one are of particular importance because of the stakes, if testimony is not understood or discredited due to a speakers use of a dialect it could mean justice isn't done or someone is wrongfully convicted. In the case of Rachel Jeantel, there are a variety of examples where Rachel uses AAVE which would be understood as ungrammatical in SAE.%0a%0aRachel uses stressed BIN: "I was been paying attention, sir".
