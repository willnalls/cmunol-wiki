After seeing a few seasons of this show, I have noticed so many cases of discrimination and stereotyping on several fronts, like sexual orientation, identity, race, and, in the case I will be speaking on in this article, accents, and language use. %0a%0aIn several cases, particularly on season 6 of this show, the host, Tyra Banks, makes comments about the model's accents. One model, Danielle Evans, a black woman from Little Rock, Arkansas, is repeatedly told (and mocked) through the season for her accent and dialect, which seems to be an AAVE / BVE dialect. Since this criticism occurs from the first episode to even the last, it is hard to point out specific examples, since the judges repeatedly tell her to reduce or completely stop using her dialect and southern accent. In one episode, where the models act in a Covergirl commercial, she is particularly judged, as her dialect would be seen as unprofessional and not like a sophisticated model for Covergirl. In it, the judges criticized her use of insertion of different vowel sounds and changing the stress on some words, like [pəɹ'fɛkʃn] into [ˌpəɹfɛk'ʃən]. They also criticized the reduction or deletion of the final consonant of words, like [tɑk] to [ta]. These criticisms connect to the general idea that certain dialects and their characteristics, like BVE, are ungrammatical and unfit for a professional world. This claim is simply untrue, as the way someone speaks due to their dialect says nothing about their professionalism or intelligence, and judging someone based on it is ridiculous. This is further proved by the fact that this model won the season. Even though she beat all the others, the host still judges her dialect, as she says 'Now you just need a voice coach!' immediately after rewarding her the win. %0a%0aHere are some Blogs that further speak about this issue and show quotes from the show with the specific criticisms I mention above: %0a%0ahttps://www.bitchmedia.org/post/the-classing-of-voice-on-americas-next-top-model-feminism-tv%0ahttps://slate.com/culture/2006/05/the-racial-politics-of-america-s-next-top-model.html%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
