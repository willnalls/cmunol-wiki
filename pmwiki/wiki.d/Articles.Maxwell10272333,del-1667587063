Most of the less than 20 native speakers alive today live in the remote village Sanjiazi in China’s far northeast province Heilongjiang. One native speaker, Meng Xianxiao, has said that “those who can really speak authentic Manchu have passed away already.” As such, Manchu is one of the world's most critically endangered languages. %0a%0aIronically, much of the decline of the Manchu language occurred during the 1800s, while the Manchus still ruled over China. Since the Manchus never accounted for more than one percent of China’s population, they had to learn Mandarin to rule China. After generations of overwhelmingly using Mandarin in their public lives, many Manchus began using Mandarin at home as well (especially those who intermarried with Han Chinese), deciding that there was simply no reason to teach their children Manchu. By the mid-1800s most of the royal court couldn’t understand Manchu; the last Manchu emperor couldn’t speak Manchu fluently. More recently, government policy has also played a role in the decline of the Manchu language. In the 1950s, Chinese government began pushing for language unification, establishing schools that taught exclusively in Mandarin; the first official Manchu course was established in 2006. Manchus have also been disconnected from much of their traditional culture as a result of the Cultural Revolution and modernization, further reducing the usefulness and appeal of learning Manchu. %0a%0aThe government has since taken some limited actions to try and preserve Manchu, such as paying 19 fluent Manchus $350 a year to assist other villagers interested in learning the language; 9 of these “language guardians” had passed away by 2017. One official in the bureau of ethnic and religious affairs, Bai Ping, explained the government’s view, saying “whether or not Manchu is passed down depends on their self-discipline. As outsiders, we can’t be too strict with them.” %0a%0aSource: https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000272/manchu%252C-once-chinas-official-language%252C-could-lose-its-voice%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)%0a(:Title: Manchu:)
