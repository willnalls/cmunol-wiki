Mainly, they are forced to Anglicize their name or other words, as well as even change or modulate their own accent to be more "American". But this seems to be against the ideals of technology, where technology conforms to the individual instead of the individual conforming to technology. This causes many people conflict between maintaining identity and being more 'understood', which further emphasizes the importance of diversifying the AI's training data, as David mentioned above.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210505-000555-838160#%0a#foxbegin 210506-111335-943340#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Difficulty using automated phone answering services %0a-> - xiranw%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aIn recent years, many businesses, instead of always having a human receptionist on the line, have switched to using automated phone answering systems to perform simple requests and/or route callers.

The article talks about how voice recognition software is unable to catch the nuances of AAVE such as the use of “be” in “they be happy” vs “they are happy” as well as the tones that are used in AAVE. Additionally, with the language model, the software tries to correct things and fill in gaps which likely links to societal bias especially since Black names are more commonly put next to things with a bad connotation. Essentially, there needs to be more equal datasets and training done to allow the software to understand AAVE.%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-032058-954470#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
