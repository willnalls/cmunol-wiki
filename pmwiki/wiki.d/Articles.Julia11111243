In English, there are multiple ways to form double comparatives.

"John is more taller than Bill than you are." (Nevins)%0aNevins cites another paper (Radford 1977) claiming that examples like the above are generally rejected by native speakers, but Seurens claims that examples similar to the above do allow for multiple comparisons, so it is not generally agreed upon whether this form of double comparison is widely accepted.%0a2.
