However, in Turkish out of the 8 vowels (⟨a⟩, ⟨e⟩, ⟨ı⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ü⟩), 2 of them are front rounded vowels. These are %3cö> (front rounded mid vowel) with phoneme [œ], used in words like %3cgöz> (meaning “eye”), pronounced as /ˈɟœz/.

Front vowels (e, i, ö, ü) are followed by front vowels, back vowels (a, ı, o, u) are followed by back vowels. Additionally, rounded vowels (o, ö, u, ü) are followed by closed rounded (u, ü) or open unrounded (a, e) vowels, and unrounded vowels (a, e, ı, i) are followed by unrounded vowels. In English, all front and central vowels are unrounded, and all back vowels are rounded, thereby creating a system where roundness is predictable based on the backness of the tongue. %0a%0a%0aEnglish Vowels IPA: https://phoible.org/inventories/view/2178#tipa %0aTurkish Vowels IPA: https://phoible.org/inventories/view/186#tipa %0aVowel Harmony in Turkish: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Turkish/Pronunciation_and_Alphabet/Vowel_Classifications_and_Harmony#:~:text=In%2520short%253A%2520Rounded%2520vowels%2520(o,are%2520followed%2520by%2520unrounded%2520vowels. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)%0a(:Title: Front Rounded Vowels: Comparing English and Turkish:)
