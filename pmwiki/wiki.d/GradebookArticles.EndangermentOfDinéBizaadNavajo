While the language would appear to be strong because of its wide use for official events, ceremonies, and common language offered in universities; other numbers point to a downturn that could put the language at risk. I could not see the EGIDS level directly through Ethnologue, but indirectly through the Endangered Language Project it sources Ethnologue and classifies the language as 'Vulnerable'.%0a%0aThere are 169,000 Navajo speakers world-wide, of which 7600 are monolinguals, and this accounts for roughly 75%25 of the Navajo population on and off the reservation. On its face this would seem like the language is very alive as this is the largest amount of speakers of a native language in the US but this would be deceiving. According to census data, however, only about a quarter of these speakers can speak it 'very well' and most only know it partly as a second language. The particular concern for the language is the spread to younger generations, while there are immersion programs for young Navajo: there are only 30%25 of L1 speakers among Navajo first-graders in 1998 which is a steep decline from the 90%25 of L1 speakers in 1968. This is mostly due to a shift towards speaking English primarily as the Navajo language falls to the wayside and is saved for mostly official purposes and for celebration of heritage amongst this younger generation. %0a%0aThis hasn't gone without notice from the tribe though, as the tribal government as well as outside institutions take active measures to help preserve the language and revitalize it through, as mentioned before, immersion programs as well as offering language courses in many large universities. %0a%0asources:%0ahttp://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/6085%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/language/nav%0ahttps://www.hcn.org/issues/47.4/most-native-tongues-of-the-west-are-all-but-lost%0ahttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/241045409_Dine_Bizaad_Navajo_Language_at_a_Crossroads_Extinction_or_Renewal%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
