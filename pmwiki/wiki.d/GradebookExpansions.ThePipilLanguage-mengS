Towards the end of the 19th century, there was massive income inequality in El Salvador. According to a research project by the Dublin City University, “0.01%25 of the population controlling 90%25 of the country’s wealth”. At that time, the majority of the Pipil people lived in western El Salvador. The inequality in the country led to an uprising in January 1932. However, the power imbalance between the demonstrators and the army meant the rebellion ended with the deaths of 10,000 to 30,000 indigenous people. Many were killed for speaking the Pipil language, wearing traditional clothing or other signs that showed they were “indigenous”. Soon after, Pipil was banned in the country and people could only communicate in Spanish.%0a%0aGiven the history of the endangerment of the Pipil language, the remaining speakers of Pipil, most of them over 50 years old, do not like to speak the language. Pipil is neither used as a main mode of communication nor spoken to the younger generation in the community. An example of a revitalization project is the Cuna Nahuat project, an early language immersion program for Pipil children aged 3 to 5 years old in a village in Sonsonate, El Salvador. The program received support from parents and members of the Pipil community. However, after the children transferred to local public schools, their parents have reported that they are asked to refrain from speaking Pipil in the classroom and some were even bullied by their classmates. These are some of the barriers facing the revitalization of the Pipil language. For the Pipil language to be used as a language that serves social and economic functions again, there would need to shift towards a bilingual and multicultural approach towards education in El Salvador. Nonetheless, the existence of such programs that receive support from the Pipil community are important steps towards the revitalization of the language.%0a%0aResources:%0ahttps://www.computing.dcu.ie/~mward/mthesis/chapter5.pdf%0ahttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/331046000_Revitalizing_Pipil_The_Cuna_Nahuat_Experience%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
