The word tryna is a contraction of “trying to” and is widely used in the United States. The word tryna is used in two separate ways and each has their own unique meaning. %0a%0aThe first way to use tryna is notated by the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project as “attempt tryna”. An example of the “attempt tryna” is: “They’re tryna open the door without the key”. In this example, the person is attempting to open the door without using the key. Many English speakers in the United States accept this usage of tryna in fast speech or colloquial registers.%0a%0aThe second meaning of tryna is called “desire tryna”. An example of the “desire tryna” is: I’m not tryna go to school tomorrow. In this sentence, the speaker desires not to go to school tomorrow. The author of the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project states that the “desire tryna” consists of the contraction of “trying to” and a bare verb. The author also mentions that the “desire tryna” is considered a feature of African American English.%0a%0aAn important note is that as the two meanings often overlap in syntactic distribution, many speakers rely on context clues to determine whether the speaker is using the “attempt tryna” or the “desire tryna”. %0a%0aAs I mentioned earlier, the use of tryna is very common in the younger generations. People in the younger generation often use tryna in their daily lives and on social media, especially Twitter. The use of social media has exposed all young americans, regardless of ethnic lines to non-standard varieties of English, such as African American English (AAE). This exposure on social media to features of AAE helps spread features of the language into the idiolects of non-AAE younger speakers, including the use of the “desire tryna”.%0a%0aSource: https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/tryna%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
