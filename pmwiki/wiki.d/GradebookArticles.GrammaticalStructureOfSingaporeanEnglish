Due to its large population of Chinese, Malay and Indian descendents and its British colonial root, the country has four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. %0a%0aIt cultural and linguistic diversity have resulted in an informal, localized form of English known as Singlish, which is infused with many characteristics of the other languages spoken in the area. As a result, grammatical constructions of Singlish are very different from standard English.%0a%0aThe most noticeable difference is Singlish's prevalent use of functional particles at the end of a clause. The particles are borrowed from Southern Chinese dialects, most notably Hokkien. When people attach different particles to the same clause, the meaning would change. Here is a set of examples which all have the structure of "can + particle" but have different underlying meanings:%0a%0a    1. "Can meh" (Can I do this?/Can this be done? - in an unsure/doubtful tone)%0a    2. "Can lah" (Alright you can do this/this can be done - in a soft, sometimes dismissing tone)%0a    3. "Can hor" (I think I can do this/this can be done but i need your confirmation)%0a%0aMaybe as you can already tell from the above examples, in Singlish people tend to drop the subject of a sentence and we often have to infer it through the context. This is very similar to the structure of Mandarin. Here are some more examples:%0a%0a    1."Don’t want lah” (I don't want this.) %0a    2."Eh, got free time this afternoon or not?" (Do you have free time this afternoon?)%0a%0aWhile sometimes Singlish speakers drop the subject, at other times they drop the verb, especially when a sentence has the structure of "subject + be + ...". Examples are as follows:%0a%0a    1. I scared. (I am scared/I was scared. - the tense really depends on the context)%0a    2. Your drink there. (Your drink is there.)%0a    3. I eating now. (I am eating now.)%0a%0aThese are just some instances of how Singlish grammatical constructions are different from standard American English.
