The Academie Francaise was established in the 15th century and out of over 700 members over the course of its existence, 8 have been women and the rest have been men. French, like many romance languages, has a baked in gender agreement structure. Nouns are categorized into masculine and femenine genders and the masculine form of the noun nearly always takes precedence. Movements in the past decades to introduce more gender neutral spellings and forms into French have been shut down by the Academie, despite common usage among many native French speakers and writers. For example, an all women group of directors would be referred to as “directrices”, but if even one man is in the group, the word becomes the masculine plural “directeurs”. The gender neutral alternative would combine these forms to become “directeur-trice-s”.%0aThe Academie stated that it could not see the “desired objective” of the changes (big surprise given the lack of diversity of its membership) and argued that it would complicate writing and speaking too much and put burden on French speakers (as if French wasn’t already unnecessarily complicated). This lack of inclusivity, resistance to evolution of the language, and prescriptivist perspective of gender inclusive language is abhorrent but unfortunately not unexpected from a group with a history of discrimination and no inclination to change. Gender inclusive language does not belong to a dialect of French (that I know of) but nonetheless the lack of acceptance towards equality in the French language is discriminatory against every person that does not identify as male, which is a good 50%25+ of the population. It's embarrassing for France that this group exists. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: C:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
