This difference is not solely confined to any particular dialect of American English. Four cases in which this switching is present are as follows: ‘On’ the weekend vs. ‘At’ the weekend, ‘In’ a period of time following a negative vs. ‘For’ a period of time following a negative, ‘On’ a street address vs. ‘In’ a street address, and ‘Through’ a span of time vs. ‘To’ a span of time.%0a	The first of these appears most commonly in the single SAE phrase ‘on the weekend’ (as opposed to ‘at the weekend’ in BE), but can also be used in different time expressions, such as SAE’s ‘We saw our grandparents on Christmas’ as opposed to BE’s ‘We saw our grandparents at Christmas. Also relating to time expression is the difference between ‘In’ (BE) and ‘For’ after a negative statement referring to a period of time. This is shown in the SAE preference for ‘I haven’t seen a movie that good in years’ as opposed to the BE ‘I haven’t seen a movie that good for years’. The last example referenced, ‘Through’ vs. ‘To’ (or ‘til’), refers more generally to the BE preference to use ‘To’ when relating the end points of a given stretch of time, where a SAE speaker would use ‘Through’. The most common example of this is in the SAE phrase ‘She had shifts Monday through Friday’ compared to the BE phrasing ‘She had shifts Monday to Friday’, but the difference can be expressed in other contexts as well.%0a	 The third example is also constrained to a specific context, being found mostly in reference to a street. In BE, the preferred way to refer to one’s home street would use ‘In’ instead of SAE’s ‘On’: ‘The Durselys lived in Privet drive’, as opposed to the SAE ‘The Simpsons lived on Evergreen Terrance’.%0a	While some of these examples occur only in some expressions, they show how the preferred grammatical constructions have varied between these two different dialects. They also do not make up hard and fast rules, but instead indicate speaker preferences in usage.%0a%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/british-and-american-english%0ahttps://www.onestopenglish.com/support-for-teaching-grammar/differences-in-american-and-british-english-grammar-article/152820.article%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
