The traditional stewards of the land were the Ohlone. They were previously known as the Costanoans by the Spanish. The IPA translation for Ohlone is “oʊloʊnɛ.” The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo relates to the land because it shifted the control of the land over from Mexico to the United States. however, the treaty did not respect any of the aboriginal tribes by not mentioning their share of the land. The Ohlone tribe speaks more than 6 languages, however I will be focusing on Chochenyo, which is spoken by the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. The Chocenyo language is being revitalized through teaching as well as the expansion of its dictionary throughout the 21st century due to the tribe’s efforts (1). The Muwekma Ohlone tribe currently hosts a Preservation foundation that is dedicated towards keeping the tribes culture alive and active (1). The language is moderately in use today with many students able to hold basic conversations through it. There is not much data about the exact number of speakers there are, but there are many efforts to keep the number of speakers growing, whether through active online resources (3), or the creation of a Chocenyo learning group through UC Berkeley’s linguistics department (2).%0a> If I were to have written a summary based only on non-indigenous sources such as (4), which is from wikipedia, I would have not known about the many efforts of linguists within the tribe to preserve their language and the tribes efforts to become federally recognized to preserve their culture in history. The facts would likely not change they would just be much more limited in breath and depth than if I used Indigenous sites. For example, Wikipedia skips over many spans of the indigenous tribe’s history and the language’s origins. However, the indigenous websites are much more thorough and include much more current impacts that their tribe has in the Bay Area.%0a> %0a> (1) http://www.muwekma.org/%0a> (2) https://cejce.berkeley.edu/ohloneland#:~:text=The%2520Ohlone%2520are%2520Native%2520American,Bay%2520Area%2520for%252010%252C000%2520years.%0a> (3) http://www.native-languages.org/ohlone.htm%0a> (4) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chochenyo_language#:~:text=Chochenyo%2520(also%2520called%2520Choche%25C3%25B1o%252C%2520Northern,languages%2520in%2520the%2520Utian%2520family.%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#contentends]]%0a> ----%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!Expansions:%0a> [[#expansions]]%0a> %0a> [[#expansionsend]]%0a> %0a> ----%0a> %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a> %0a> (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a> %0a> (:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a> %0a> You must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a> %0a> (:else:)%0a> %0a> (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a> %0a> (:ifend:)%0a> %0a> ----%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!Comments%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ----%0a> (:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a> !!Change article category%0a> (:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a> (:ifend:)%0a> %0a> %0a> (:Section: C:)%0a> (:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)%0a> (:Title: Ohlone Tribe:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
