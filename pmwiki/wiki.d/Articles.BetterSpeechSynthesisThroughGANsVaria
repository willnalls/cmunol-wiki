GANs are networks consisting of two neural networks: one that generates fake data (a generator) and one that tries to tell fake data apart from real data (a discriminator).

Depending on the level of fine-tuning, networks can either start with just random weights (in which both parties could be guessing), or they could start with weights pretrained architectures for the types of data they are using.%0a%0aI read a paper recently on the work of one team of researchers in using Generative Adversarial Networks, which you can find here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11646.pdf.%0a%0aI'll spare you from some of the gritty technical details (although if you are interested in this sort of stuff, the use of Random Window Discriminators [RWDs] as opposed to a single discriminator is really interesting) and stick to the high-level results. By having these networks play this game against one another and learn without really any human input aside from the training data of genuine audio, the researchers efficiently generated a network that was evaluated as sounding pretty natural by humans.%0a%0aIt's interesting to see how much progress Machine Learning can make in spaces like speech generation, which (as per what I've read, but I'm no expert), traditional approaches face a lot of difficulty.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210508-031454-743700#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-07.05.2021 - 20:14-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210508-031454-743700 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!AlexX%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''NLP and Machine Learning'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aI think it's interesting that you bring up how machine learning make progress where traditional linguistics-based approaches fail - it seems like the cost of this progress is the ability to understand "why" things are happening.
