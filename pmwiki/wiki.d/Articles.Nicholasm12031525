This is done in a particular way through music and poetic verse, especially in folk traditions. Folk music brings together the storytelling of all language use, the emotive techniques of poetry, and “a repository of national culture” (Yarmakeev, 235). Thus, folk music can be used for unique pedagogical purposes—both for first and foreign language studies. For foreign language studies, folk music gives students access to recognizable and familiar emotive and social descriptors in their new language. A study introducing Russian children to English-language folk music found significant improvements in language acquisition and use over their control group class without the use of music, with an especially notable difference in the use of idioms (Yarmakeev, 239). In first language studies, the stories and repetitive nature of songs can encourage deeper engagement with their own language and culture. A potential concern in using folk music for teaching is the presence of “unusual sentence patterns,” but children actually strengthen their language comprehension by engaging with use patterns different from their own. The method of comparison between the content in folk songs and students’ own lives also allows for a teaching of cultural history that, in regular classroom contexts, can be considered difficult or boring by the same students (Martin, 327-328).%0a%0aYarmakeev, Iskander E., et al. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311605672_Folk_songs_do_magic_in_teaching_speech_and_grammar_patterns_in_EFL_class.%0a%0aMartin, Rita J. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41961304.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-062757-18340#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Folk Music as a Means of Preserving Language %0a-> - jackagui%0a-> [-08.12.2022 - 22:27-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-062757-18340 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aFolk music can not only be used to teach foreign languages, but also to preserve them. Patrick Shuldam-Shaw was a folk musician documenting folk music from a man in Shetland named John Stickle, when Stickle offered to play him a song that was "nonsensical". Unbeknownst to Stickle, the song was actually an excerpt from 'King Orfeo', a song with no known melody, and the lyrics he thought were nonsense were actually in Norn, a language that had fallen out of use hundreds of years prior. Also interesting to note is the fact that the story tells the story of King Orfeo, whose wife is taken by the fairy king. Orfeo is able to rescue her, however, by playing music to impress the fairy king. This is a clear adaptation of the Greek myth of Orpheus, and it's interesting to think about how far back the stories behind different folk songs go.%0a%0ahttps://www.jstor.org/stable/4521648 (p. 130)%0ahttps://www.jstor.org/stable/4521266 (pp. 77-78)%0ahttps://archive.org/details/englishandscotti01chiluoft/page/n227/mode/2up (pp. 215-217)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221209-062757-18340#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 221210-040804-299570#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-09.12.2022 - 20:08-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-040804-299570 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!nathandeyak%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Learnability'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aIt is interesting to hypothesize about the value of a musical rhythm/melody on the ability of people to recall novel words.
