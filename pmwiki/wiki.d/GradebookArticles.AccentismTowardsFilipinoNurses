It involves 69 immigrants who were constantly mocked for their accent in a California hospital. Bosses and coworkers allegedly listened in on their conversations with each other and harassed them for their accents. They were also prohibited from speaking Tagalog to each other within the hospital. Apparently security guards were assigned to keep an eye on them and report if they saw them speaking in Tagalog with each other. %0a%0aIn this case, speaking a non-English language itself is seen as unprofessional. Additionally, the way that Filipino immigrants speak English is also being mocked. %0aAs a matter of fact, there is no standard Filipino accent because of the range of languages spoken in the country. It ranges from standard American english because the Philippines has been an American colony to a Filip-Tagalog accent. In this accent, there is no tap sound in words like "butter" and the word is actually spoken like two discrete words, such as 'bʌt.təɹ'. In this case, the linguistic discrimination seems to have occurred for no other purpose but the sake of discriminating because Manila english is just as comprehensible as standard American english. This is an example of where prescriptivism can be harmful and discriminatory towards demographics that do not speak the superstratum language. %0a%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.latimes.com/health/la-xpm-2012-sep-18-la-me-english-only-20120918-story.html%0a%0ahttps://www.dialectsarchive.com/philippines-3%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
