When a word has a singular morpheme, it has all fingers extended, closed, curved, or bent. The handshapes can also be considered marked or unmarked. Less marked words/sounds are usually easier to sign and produce. Orientation of the hand, such as whether the palm is facing up or down, can also have an impact on the phonology of a word in sign language. Next, location is a major element in sign language. Each free morpheme is dedicated to a certain part of the body. Location can also be in relation to the morpheme that precedes the current one. This is usually for common words that have frequently used paths. This is because it is easier than having to go from your arm, to your torso, to your head. Finally, movement is an essential part of the phonology of words in sign language. Lexical signs can be attributed to specific series of movements. This often involves morphemes moving to locations in relation to one another, rather than specific locations. Movement also includes the movement of two hands or the repeated movement of one hand. Movement is considered the most important way to distinguish between and move to the next syllable in words. %0a%0aSource: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608481/ %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
