Studies have shown, however, that there is a critical period of language acquisition, which lasts from about 2 years old until puberty. If a language is not learned within this time (either a first or second language), the person will have trouble using it to communicate. Language acquisition studies are unethical, but scientists have found a few people that were not exposed to language as children. The most famous of these case studies is Genie. She was not exposed to language until she was around 13 years old. Because of this, she was past her critical period and not able to completely learn English. Although she was able to acquire some of the language, she had abnormal speech patterns and wasn’t able to effectively communicate with others. This shows that Chomsky’s theory only applies to young children who are exposed regularly to a language. Without exposure during the critical period, it is very difficult for humans to acquire a new language. %0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_deprivation%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221204-231910-549270#%0a#foxbegin 221209-185714-623340#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Lenneberg's Contribution to Biolinguistics  %0a-> - ahmed%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 10:57-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-185714-623340 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aRelated to the two ideologies stated above, in 1967 Eric Lenneberg took a different approach in incorporating other fields to explain the faculty of language.

Under this view, in the same way organ development is a hallmark of biological growth, a child's language development would be an indicator in the growth of the "mental organ" responsible for language. %0a%0a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biolinguistics#Relevance_of_Natural_Law%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221209-185714-623340#%0a#foxbegin 221210-023346-963090#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!The FOXP2 gene %0a-> - dennyy%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 18:33-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-023346-963090 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe FOXP2 is a gene found in many animals that acts as a transcription factor.
