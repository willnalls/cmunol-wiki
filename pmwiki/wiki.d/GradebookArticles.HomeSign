This system of communication usually relies more on "gestures" than "signs" (i.e., includes making faces and movements with other parts of the body instead of just the hands), and thus it is still up for debate whether these systems adhere to the distinct grammatical rules of most languages. A home sign differs from sign language in a few ways, as defined by Nancy Frishberg. Home signs: do not have a consistent meaning-symbol relationship, do not pass on between generations, and are not shared between multiple people.%0a%0aInteresting enough though, there are many cross-cultural similarites between home signers, despite their systems being invented seperately. For example, children in Turkey and America exhibit similar patterns in sentence structure, moreso than the spoken languages of those regions do. This is perhaps indicative that all humans, regardless of race and location, have a built sign language of sorts. For example, the large majority of cultures will recognize gestures such as pointing, head shaking, shrugging, etc.. A combination of these gestures, along with similar but more personalized and individual ones, can form an effective means of communication for a deaf child that is not taught a sign language. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_sign%0ahttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780429020872-7/homesign-systems-joseph-hill-diane-lillo-martin-sandra-wood%0ahttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15248372.2013.803970%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
