Online, I have seen British English (BrE) speakers point this out as "bad grammar", but I argue that it is just a dialectal difference which follows its own set of rules.%0a%0aHere are some examples (from https://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.com/2007/01/could-not-care-less-adverbs.html and https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/adverbs-and-adjectives/3702382.html):%0a%0aHe did it real(ADJ) well. vs He did it really(ADV) well.%0aHe did it real(ADJ) good(ADJ). vs He did it really(ADV) well(ADV).%0aShe did that so cute(ADJ). vs She did that so cutely(ADV).%0aToday is going slow(ADJ). vs Today is going slowly(ADV).%0a%0aAll of these examples can be grammatical in conversational AmE (though some may be more than others), however an average BrE speaker would not say the ones on the left. AmE speakers are also starting to use some of these adjectives in less casual contexts (such as the last example or "it works great" in a work email). There is a trend these forms being accepted more and more in the US and the UK, so some BrE speakers blame Americans for this "degradation" of the language. However, some British dialects already have had the same pattern. Additionally, the pattern has some rules and syntax of its own. %0a%0aFor one thing, only adverbs that modify verbs or other adverbs tend to be replaced with adjectives. Another interesting point is where in a sentence the adjective-adverbs can be used compared to regular adverbs.%0a%0aExamples (from https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/the-americans-have-no-adverbs):%0a[1] You should eat it up "quickly"(ADV) before someone else gets it.%0a[2] You should "quickly"(ADV) eat it up before someone else gets it.%0a[3] You should eat it up "quick"(ADJ) before someone else gets it.%0a[4] *You should "quick"(ADJ) eat it up before someone else gets it.%0a%0a[1] and [2] show that the adverb form can be placed before or after the verb "eat". [3] and [4] show that the adjective form only works after the verb.%0a  %0aI think these adjectives are perfectly intelligible in place of adverbs in the cases they are used, so they are convenient short forms. I also understand if BrE speakers think this sentence reads "unnatural". *But you couldn't say it's "unequivocal" wrong. *Nor could you say this one "great" works.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-220449-585710#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Non-native speaker's take on replacing adv. with adj. %0a-> - yuluz%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAs a non-native English speaker, I was taught to always use adverbs when describing a verb (eg. doing well, eat quickly) or an adjective (eg. very good, perfectly made). This rule is stuck in my head ever since day one, so whenever I hear people replacing adverbs with adjectives, it rings a bell in my head and sometimes would give me a bit of a cringe. %0a%0aPutting aside my grammar education, I think in conversation American English context, replacing an adverb with an adjective convey a more laid-back and sincere attitude. For example, when someone uses the phrase "real good" when speaking with another person, I think it means that the speaker is loosened up and relaxed around the listener. While if someone uses "really good", it could be that he/she is not very close to the listener and out of politeness it was better to use the complete adverb.%0a%0aAt other times, using adjective in place of an adverb can convey a slightly different meaning. In the example of "Today is going slow(ADJ)." vs "Today is going slowly(ADV).", when we say the day is going slow, it is more like the speaker is having a long and tired day. While if we say the day is going slowly, I feel like it is much more literal as if it  means that the day, just like a person, is actually going/walking slowly.  %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-220449-585710#%0a#foxbegin 210509-035739-555800#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Adv. and Adj. exchange %0a-> - jnflores%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aSuper interesting topic!
