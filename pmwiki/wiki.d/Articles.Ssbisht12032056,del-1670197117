In spoken languages, the phonology is evident from sounds, but this is clearly a characteristic of spoken languages. In ASL, the basic phonemes are handshape, movement, location, orientation, and nonmanual signs or facial expression. Examples of allophones are thus things like different bending of fingers or different positioning of fingers. Most of the information I found related to handshape, although the rest are definitely still relevant to the phonology.%0aAs for morphology, many ASL words are derived from compounding. Similar to how devoicing occurs in spoken languages, compounds form from hold deletion, a phonological process which is where the hold at the end of the first word and the hold at the beginning of the second word are combined. Additionally, many ASL nouns come from verbs, for example SIT and CHAIR or FOOD and EATING, which only differ by a movement. Another interesting thing was how numbers are used in ASL. If one wanted to signify three months, they would simply add the handshape for 3 to the sign for months. Suffixation does not occur as often in ASL as in English.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Phonology and Morphology in ASL:)
