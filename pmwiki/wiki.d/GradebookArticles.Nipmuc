This is where I was born and lived for the first few years of my life before moving to Florida, so it will always hold a special place in my heart.%0a%0aThe original inhabitants of the land were the Nipmuc (nɪpmʌk) tribe, meaning “fresh water people”, whose land spread across the interior portion of Massachusetts as well as parts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The tribe was devastated by early encounters with European colonizers, resulting in an estimated 80%25 mortality rate before the English even landed on the shores. When the English did arrive at Plymouth in 1620, there were an estimated 5000-6000 Nipmucs still in the area, mainly living along nearby rivers and streams. Early encounters with the English were friendly, but this did not last long. Soon after their arrival, the English began to work on converting the tribe to the English way of life. Many of the Nipmucs did adopt the English way of life, setting up and inhabiting “praying villages” in which they lived similarly but separate from the English. There are no treaties relating to the land.%0a%0aThe Nipmuc spoke a dialect of the Narragansett language. While the language died out over a century ago, some young Nipmuc descendants are working on reviving it. The language is not spoken in everyday life as it is not well known, even by those in the Nipmuc tribe, but it is used ceremonially. Additionally, there is a website dedicated to the preservation and teaching of the Nipmuc language.%0a%0aI was unable to find data from an indigenous-run source on the number of speakers of the Nipmuc language, though it seems likely to be a small subset of the now ~600-person tribe.%0a%0a%0aAn article about the Nipmuc language from NPR was able to provide a greater wealth of information on the status of the language. There are only about 10 people who speak Nipmuc, one of whom is an electrician from Brimfield, MA named David White. The aforementioned website dedicated to the Nipmuc language is run by White, whose mission is to save the language of his tribe from dying out. A summary of the language based only on non-indigenous sources as opposed to indigenous sources would not be terribly different as there truly is not a great amount of information on the language from either set of sources. As the Nipmuc are such a small tribe now and have a very complex and intertwined history with other tribes such as the Narragansett and Mohegan, even indigenous websites do not present Nipmuc as its own language, but rather a dialect of Narragansett. The non-indigenous NPR article makes no mention of the Narragansett, focusing solely on David White and his efforts to restore the Nipmuc language. Hopefully in the near future White’s efforts will succeed and the Nipmuc language will become recognized once again.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.nipmucnation.org/%0ahttps://www.nipmucmuseum.org/history/%0ahttp://nipmucnation.homestead.com/Welcome.html%0ahttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/weshallremain-nipmuc-language/%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/narragansett.htm%0ahttps://www.nipmuclanguage.org/%0ahttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103028551%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
