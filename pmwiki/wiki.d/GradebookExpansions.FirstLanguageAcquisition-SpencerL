Having been raised by parents with different language backgrounds, the argument about conversations as an effective tool for babies to learn languages should mean that I would be at least verbally fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. This is not the case, I cannot speak a single word in Cantonese and have semi-fluency in day to day conversations in Mandarin. I am obviously fluent in English, as I was raised in the US and attended school where English was the primary language. Even at a young age, I was exposed to both Cantonese and Mandarin. This would include programs specifically made for language learning and even everyday conversations with family members. However, I spoke English most of the time, due to the fact that most of my days were spent at school. Now at the age of 19, I found myself to be verbally lacking in both. I would agree that most of sounds/voices we hear in our childhood is from our parents, but I would argue that this claim made can be extended with still the overall environment we are raised. Having been away from my parents for a whole semester, I struggled to converse in Mandarin with my parents when I came back for winter break. This resulted in me using English instead. My decrease in Mandarin skills stems from the fact that I was not able to use the language regularly, thus losing a lot of confidence in behavioral familiarity with the language.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
