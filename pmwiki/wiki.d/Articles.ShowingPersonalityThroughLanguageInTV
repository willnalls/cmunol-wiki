Keigo is distinct from normal Japanese speech such that people are addressed using a more respectful tone and endings such as -masu are utilized. This is similar to the usted/ustedes conjugations in Spanish. Keigo is normally used with elders, superiors, and some strangers while normal speech is used with friends, family, classmates, etc. %0a%0aTwo examples of how Keigo can be used to give insight into personality are Levi Ackerman and Sasha Blouse from the Japanese Anime titled Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin). Generally, the world depicted in an anime can either respect the rules of Keigo or not. Even though Attack on Titan is not set in Japan, it still shows characters respecting the rules of Keigo except of course Levi and Sasha. Levi is shown to be a very cold and inconsiderate character from the beginning along with being highly respected for being very skilled in slaying titans. As such, he often omits Keigo when speaking with elders or uses it sarcastically in a mocking fashion. The few times he uses Keigo seriously are with the small subset of people that he truly respects. %0a%0aOn the other hand, Sasha breaks the rules of Keigo in the opposite manner. She uses Keigo with her peers and fellow trainees who are of similar age and social status. Because of this, she places herself on a lower standing than her peers. This highlights her insecurities and inferiority complex in comparison to her classmates, and the show later reveals that it is due to her countryside upbringing. When she gradually stops using Keigo with her peers, it signals to the viewer that Sasha is becoming confident and secure in her abilities. %0a%0aThese nuances may seem small to the English viewer reading subtitles and are often not caught. This is because Keigo does not substantially change the translation to English when compared with normal speech, so these ideas are lost in translation. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210509-025521-87390#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Other Examples of personality through language which are lost in translation %0a-> - albert_l%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a    An aspect of the Japanese language which also seems to be lost in translation or not properly conveyed through subtitling are sentence endings. Sentence ending particles, (終助詞, shuujoshi) are used often in the Japanese language to denote the grammatical structure of a sentence or to add nuance in communication. For example, ending a sentence with “か” (/kɐ/) denotes that the previous statement is “unknown”, for the purpose of questions or marking indefinite pronouns. Sentence ending particles are also used to add personality or emphasis to statements. For example, “さ” (/sɐ/) is used as an statement emphasis marker, and is primarily seen in masculine speech. An example of a sentence ending that wasn’t conveyed in subtitling occurred in the 1st episode of Vivy - Flourite Eye’s Song, where the female character Momoka uses the sentence ending particle “わよ” (/wɐjo/), an emphatic feminine sentence ending particle consisting of an opinion marker followed by a emotional emphasis marker. %0a    %0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210509-025521-87390#%0a#foxbegin 210509-025609-975050#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Other Examples of personality through language which are lost in translation %0a-> - albert_l%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a    An aspect of the Japanese language which also seems to be lost in translation or not properly conveyed through subtitling are sentence endings.
