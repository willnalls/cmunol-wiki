In particular, this example represents a lowering of the [ɔ] sound in y'all and consonant deletion between the final two words.

I think that the existing power dynamic between Standard American English, a dialect in the superstratum, and dialects such as AAVE, which are in the substratum, may cause communities such as Idris's to think that people speaking in Standard American English are giving a verbal signal of superiority. Speaking in Standard American English could cause these communities to think that the people speaking Standard American English are flaunting their access to more opportunities and privilege, making the communities feel defensive about their own social status. Moreover, I think that these communities could also be feeling a sense of abandonment when someone who grew up in the community suddenly rejects the community's dialect in favor of Standard American English.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210415-162723-320480#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
