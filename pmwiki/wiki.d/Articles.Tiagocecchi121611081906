While not precisely a variant of English, it heavily borrows from English as well as from a variety of African languages. Along with Nigerian English, it is the lingua franca of Nigeria; however, while most government documents are written in Nigerian English, Nigerian Pidgin has historically been regarded as associated with low education or economic status. Furthermore, Nigerian Pidgin has not had a standard orthographic system for the majority of its history.%0aDespite having similar syntax to American English, sentences from Nigerian Pidgin and American English conveying the same meaning can be quite different. Consider a standard greeting in English, ”How are you today?”. In Pidgin, this would typically be said as ”How you dey?”. Similarly, ”I want to eat” becomes ”I wan chop”. As in the previous examples, many function words, pronouns and action verbs are often carried over from English and arranged into a similar sentence structure. Consider also ”E be like film”, a statement of incredulity. Clearly, this has similarity to the typical American English sentence ”this is like a film”, but also shows how Nigerian Pidgin has a greater tendency to delete function words. The sentence ”E cost too abeg” similarly resembles ”The cost is too high”, but again with the function word ”is” deleted. This is most likely due to the widespread use of Nigerian Pidgin across markets in Nigeria; often bartering will require expedient communication.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: MorphosyntacticDiversityOfEnglish:)%0a(:Title: Nigerian Pidgin:)
