In other words, we compare the consonants used in English and Filipino. This is an interesting comparison because Filipino derives much of its orthographic alphabet from the American English Alphabet.

All of the affricates are removed, and many of the fricatives are omitted as well. This demonstrates the Austronesian roots of Filipino, as many Austronesian languages have few fricatives. Thus this trend persists despite the switch to an American Alphabet. There are some other modifications to the consonants as spoken, but are variations on the same base placing, manner, and voice.%0a%0aReferences:%0aSteven Moran and Daniel McCloy and Richard Wright. 2019.
