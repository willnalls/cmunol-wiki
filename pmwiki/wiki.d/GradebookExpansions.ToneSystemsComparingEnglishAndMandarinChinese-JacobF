This was done because little to no gains had been demonstrated in using pitch, aside from the occasional system which tailored itself purely to one language.%0a%0aHowever, the researchers in this article, through a deep neural network, were able to utilize pitch and tonal features to dramatically improve tonal language recognition, and even slightly improve recognition for non-tonal languages. The exact setup is a little hard to follow, particularly because they frequently reference models and results from other papers, but the overall findings presented at the end are hopeful, and the conclusion sums up the research well.%0a%0ahttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/fmetze/interACT//Publications_files/publications/babel-tonal.pdf%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000939-683190#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000939-683190#
