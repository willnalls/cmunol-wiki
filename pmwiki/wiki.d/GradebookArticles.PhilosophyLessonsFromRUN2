If the river RUNS down to a street which RUNS to the ballot office, consider a RUN for president; you may even have a clear RUN at the office! The election will RUN for a day, but it will RUN you about 3 million dollars. However, if you RUN your campaign poorly, or RUN short on money, rumors may RUN through your supporters that you RUN drugs, or even RUN around with the cartels yourself, and tabloids may RUN a story that you need to be RUN out of town. If the buses RUN, you can use them to ditch town. If you’ve RUN up an unpaid debt, though, you are now on the RUN. If the bus RUNs out of the fuel that it RUNs on (what a RUN of bad luck!), you’ll have to leave. Escape to a ski RUN, and ask to be given the RUN of the lodge there. Don’t eat the eggs though, they can give you the RUNs. If there’s a baseball field, try and score a few RUNs, but the extra stretching may give you a RUN in your stockings, and if you go really hard you could RUN a temperature. RUN a bath afterwards to cool down. Don’t RUN your mouth about why you’re there though, or you may have a RUN-in with the police! You don’t want to RUN afoul of them, they won’t care how much your eyes RUN. But with this I RUN dry of examples.%0a%0a%0aClearly, Nacirema culture is preoccupied with expediency and immediacy. From describing themselves, to their bodies (eyes, nose) to their machines (computers, busses), to inanimate objects which aren’t even capable of motion (rivers, roads), to intangible concepts (luck) the Nacirema language is laden with references to ‘running’. I posit a potentially fatalistic, or at least death-conscious, culture, in which an implicit need or desire to finish things quickly (before they run out of time, i.e. die), shapes their words. If they do things quickly, they can do many things, and they will not have wasted their time and die unhappy. Those who ‘run’ things the best, indeed, are the most successful. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
