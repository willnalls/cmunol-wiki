When my father immigrated to the US, he said that he was able to better learn English by forcing himself to think in it. He says that today he thinks in both English and Gujarati (his primary language), and I wonder what types of thoughts/emotions are associated with each language. I find it hard to believe that he switches back and forth completely randomly. There must be some rhyme and reason to it. I know when bilingual people speak to each other they often switch back and forth seamlessly because (I'm assuming) some ideas can be better expressed in one language as opposed to another.
