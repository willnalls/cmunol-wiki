It is spoken in regions of the Sichuan Province in China (1). It is reported that there are around 5,000 native speakers and only 200 people who speak solely Namuyi (1). Namuyi has an EGIDS level of around 5-6a,  which means that it is not sustained by formal institutions, but people speak it in their communities and children learn it (3). Namuyi is well-preserved in some villages, where only people aged twenty and less with a primary school education can speak Chinese. (Everyone else speaks Namuyi.) However, in other villages, it is mostly spoken by people who were born before 1955 (2). While people speak it with community and family members, the population, especially the younger generation, prefers to speak the Sichuan dialect of Chinese (2). In fact, more and more teenagers are beginning to not understand Namuyi. While interviewing speakers of the language, they mention that because people feel like there is no need to understand and speak Namuyi, people are using it less and less (2). Children are being taught Chinese instead of Namuyi, because parents believe it will allow them to have better lives and get better jobs outside their village in the future (2).%0a> %0a> Sources:%0a> (1) https://www.elararchive.org/dk0217/ %0a> (2) https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/21 %0a> (3) https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nmy %0a> %0a> [[#contentends]]%0a> ----%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!Expansions:%0a> [[#expansions]]%0a> %0a> [[#expansionsend]]%0a> %0a> ----%0a> %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a> %0a> (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a> %0a> (:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a> %0a> You must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a> %0a> (:else:)%0a> %0a> (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a> %0a> (:ifend:)%0a> %0a> ----%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!Comments%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ----%0a> (:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a> !!Change article category%0a> (:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a> (:ifend:)%0a> %0a> %0a> (:Section: E:)%0a> (:Category: MorphosyntacticDiversityOfEnglish:)%0a> (:Title: Namuyi:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
