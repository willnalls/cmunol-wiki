She originally moved to London, where people where kind and showed interest in her Polish English accent. However, after moving to Kent, another city in the UK, she faced discrimination from other based on her accent. She says that she tended to tell people she is from South Africa rather than Poland because certain people react with less hostility. In her own words, she describes that people are “unkind” to her due to her accent and it makes her feel “sorry” and “bruised” inside. She explains how her prior workplace was “insular” and said she was a rude person and others had told her this stigma was because of her harsh sounding accent. Because of the language discrimination she faced, she is very keen on getting rid of her accent and is seeking help from a language teacher to do so.  %0aAfter looking in the second article posted below, I was able to see many examples of pronunciation errors found in the Polish English accent. Kasha provides an example of the word ‘water’ and how she had originally pronounced it as [wɒːə] instead of [wɔːtə]. The main difference here is that she cannot create the [t] sound. This seems very similar to #3 in the article about how Polish English speakers struggle with consonant/vowel joining. The example they provide includes ‘What_are’ where the underscore is a similar difficulty. Also, whilst hearing her speak I was able to identify many other similarities. For example, I noticed she pronounced ‘changing’ [ˈʧeɪnʤɪŋ] as [ˈʧeʒɪŋk] where I noticed a large contrast in the vowel pronunciation and the [k] sound at the end. The [k] at the end of -ing agrees with #7 in the article. When holisitically listening to the Polish English accent, I am mainly able to distinguish the differences in the vowel sounds and the struggle to pronounce diphthongs. This is because Polish has very few vowel sounds, consisting of 8 total vowel sounds.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5BT4Li2wEk%0ahttps://pronunciationstudio.com/polish-speakers-english-pronunciation-errors/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild%0a:Essential: {Category.LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild$:essential}%0a:Title: Polish English Accent Discrimination%0a:Author: sathyas%0a:Section: E%0a:Completed: 14.04.2021 - 21:58%0a:Status: complete%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aPolish woman faces accent discrimination in Kent, a city in the UK.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aThe video below is about a woman named Kasha who moved to the UK from Poland.
