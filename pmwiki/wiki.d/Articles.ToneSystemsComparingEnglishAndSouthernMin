Tones can describe a relatively flat pitch on words, or a moving pattern such as the pitch rising from low to high or falling from high to low. Tones with moving patterns of pitch are called contour tones. %0a%0aThis is somewhat similar to intonation, which also involves changes in pitch. However, the difference between tone and intonation is that intonation uses the changes in pitch for more general functions such as emphasizing certain parts of a sentence or identifying sentences as a question, rather than changing the meaning of words.%0a%0aThe category of tone system differentiates between languages with and without tones and describes how many different tones a language has. The World Atlas of Linguistic Structures Online (WALS) has three values for tone systems – no tones, simple tone system, and complex tone system. No tones describes languages with no tones, a simple tone system describes languages with only 2 different tones, while a complex tone system is used to describe languages with more than 2 tones. %0a%0aEnglish is categorized as having no tones, while Min (Southern) is described to have a complex tone system. English does have intonation. For example, there is a rising tone at the end of certain yes/no questions. However, changes in pitch do not change the meaning of syllables or words. Therefore, English is not considered to have any tones.%0a%0aMin (Southern) includes a range of languages, with distinct differences in the language spoken by different groups in regions such as China, Taiwan, and Malaysia. While these languages all have a complex tone system, there is a difference in the number of distinct tones within each language. For example, Hokkien is generally regarded as having 8 different tones. However, Hokkien from certain regions such as Taiwan or Penang are regarded as having 6 or 7 tones as they do not distinguish between certain tones. The tone pattern may also change between variations of Hokkien. %0a%0aOne question I have is the process of learning and recognizing distinct tones in languages. I learned Mandarin Chinese as part of my formal school system, and have no issues recognizing the four basic tones in the language. On the other hand, I have very limited proficiency in Hokkien, having only learned it from hearing my immediate family members communicate. While I largely understand sentences in Hokkien, I cannot really speak the language outside of common phrases or sentences. However, I am unable to identify the different tones within the Hokkien language and tend to link the pronunciation of Hokkien words back to the 4 tones of Mandarin Chinese I am familiar with. Therefore, I wonder if this inability to recognize tones can be attributed to my lack of proficiency in the language, existing familiarity with another language with a different tonal system, or lack of formal schooling and study of the language.%0a%0aReferences:%0a%0aMaddieson, Ian. “Tone.” The World Atlas of Language Structures Online, Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology., wals.info/chapter/13.%0a %0a“Taiwanese Hokkien.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 11 Feb. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210227-124343-725240#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Southern Min has tone sandhi which makes it very challenging to learn %0a-> - Mingkang_L%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aPerception of tones by infants learning a non-tone language%0aAuthor links open overlay panel%0a%0a%0a%0aThe first reason might be the lack of exposure to Southern Min during infancy. Although the ability to perceive tones is universally present in infants, this ability deteriorates rapidly. In a study on the perception of tones by infants learning a non-tone language, Liu and Kager found that infants are able to discriminate tonal contrasts at 5–6 months, but their tonal sensitivity deteriorates at around 9 months, after which time a salient contrast may remain discriminable throughout infancy, whereas a less salient one does not. Southern Min usually has five to seven tones depending on the region, but all of the tones don’t have register differences, making them harder to distinguish than those in Mandarin. So, if we don’t have early exposure to the language, it might be difficult to learn to distinguish them as non-native speakers. Personally, I’m a native speaker of Mandarin, but I can’t really distinguish the tones in Min either.%0a%0aThe second reason might be that Southern Min has tone sandhi, which refers to the change in tones under the influence of adjacent words. The same Chinese character usually has different tones when it is pronounced in isolation, in words, and when it is put into a longer sentence. Tone sandhi is an important feature in Southern Min that’s not present in Mandarin. The rules for tone sandhi are EXTREMELY complicated and is almost impossible to be mastered by non-native speakers. (if you are interested, the second link below is a 200-page dissertation describing the tone sandhi in Southern Min in detail). Just knowing the tones for each Chinese character isn’t enough because you still have to learn how the tones change when they are combined with other words with different tones. That probably explains why the tones in Southern Min can be very challenging to learn. Hope you find this helpful.%0a%0aCitation %0aLiu, Liquan, and René Kager.
