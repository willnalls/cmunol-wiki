He then dismissed her by sarcastically asking if there was anyone else with a question formulated in French.%0a%0aAfter doing some research, I found two main differences between Southern and Northern French accents, although there are definitely more differences than mentioned here. Firstly, if “e” appears at the end of a syllable, it is pronounced for Southern accents but not for a Northern accent. For instance, in the video, Mélenchon imitated the reporter by pronouncing “qu’est-ce que”(what) as [kɛsə] [kə] in a Southern French accent, instead of [kɛs] [kə]. Secondly, Southern accents tend to pronounce word-final alveolar nasals further back in the mouth, often producing a velar nasal instead. For instance, “parfaitement” would change from [pæfetmẽn] in a Northern accent to [pæfetəmeŋ] in a Southern accent.%0a%0aIn France, there is heavy discrimination towards regional French accents. Speaking with an accent other than the standard Parisian French accent could affect the types of employment that are open to you, such as jobs in broadcasting, civil service, academia and telemarketing. This is because in France, regional accents considered less professional. This perception stems from the prestige associated with the region of Paris. Historically, Paris was the place of residence for French kings and writers of major French dictionaries as well as the place where the biggest media outlets are located. On the other hand, regional accents were ruthlessly clamped down on in schools during the French Third Republic. Teachers were tasked to “correct the flaws in pronunciation or local accent”. In fact, the situation has become so serious that a law was passed in November 2020 to disallow discrimination based on accents in France, an act termed la glottophobie.%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.thelocal.fr/20200708/france-regional-accents-parisian-why-are-french-people-so-snobbish-when-it-comes-to-regional-accents/%0ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/2d6hqm/apenthetic_%25C5%258B_after_nasalized_vowels_in_southern/%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQlz_bbpzw%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild%0a:Essential: {Category.LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild$:essential}%0a:Title: Linguistic Discrimination in the French Language%0a:Author: meng_s%0a:Section: E%0a:Completed: 24.04.2021 - 15:12%0a:Status: complete%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aIn this article, I discuss the discrimination faced by speakers of Southern French Accents.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aWe have been examining different dialects of English so far, so I thought it would be interesting to examine linguistic discrimination of accents from another language, French.%0a%0aIn the following video, a French politician, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, mocks a reporter for her Southern accent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpoaodwmkJc%0a%0aThe reporter was asking Mélenchon about recent police searches conducted at his place of residence, when Mélenchon interrupted her by asking “What does that mean?”.
