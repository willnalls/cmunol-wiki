While the language would appear to be strong because of its wide use for official events, ceremonies, and common language offered in universities; other numbers point to a downturn that could put the language at risk. I could not see the EGIDS level directly through Ethnologue, but indirectly through the Endangered Language Project it sources Ethnologue and classifies the language as 'Vulnerable'.%0a%0aThere are 169,000 Navajo speakers world-wide, of which 7600 are monolinguals, and this accounts for roughly 75%25 of the Navajo population on and off the reservation. On its face this would seem like the language is very alive as this is the largest amount of speakers of a native language in the US but this would be deceiving. According to census data, however, only about a quarter of these speakers can speak it 'very well' and most only know it partly as a second language. The particular concern for the language is the spread to younger generations, while there are immersion programs for young Navajo: there are only 30%25 of L1 speakers among Navajo first-graders in 1998 which is a steep decline from the 90%25 of L1 speakers in 1968. This is mostly due to a shift towards speaking English primarily as the Navajo language falls to the wayside and is saved for mostly official purposes and for celebration of heritage amongst this younger generation. %0a%0aThis hasn't gone without notice from the tribe though, as the tribal government as well as outside institutions take active measures to help preserve the language and revitalize it through, as mentioned before, immersion programs as well as offering language courses in many large universities. %0a%0asources:%0ahttp://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/6085%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/language/nav%0ahttps://www.hcn.org/issues/47.4/most-native-tongues-of-the-west-are-all-but-lost%0ahttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/241045409_Dine_Bizaad_Navajo_Language_at_a_Crossroads_Extinction_or_Renewal%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210509-034958-631220#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Navajo Code Talkers %0a-> - JacobF%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThough certainly within the realm of public consciousness, I thought I would still write with this expansion on the Navajo Code Talkers of World War II.%0a%0aBecause of how undocumented their language was, during World War II the United States military employed 29 Navajo men to make secret codes based on their language.

A Navajo verb encapsulates a wealth of information through prefixation. In fact, a single Navajo verb can be equivalent to a complete sentence in English. There are up to 10 prefixes that can be added to verb stems, though some prefixes are mutually dependent or exclusive. In a video (linked below), the phrase “I kissed Sally”, “Sally nánétz'ó̜ó̜z” in Navajo, is explained. While the verb “kissed” in English is only composed of the verb stem /kiss/ and the past tense morpheme /-ed/, “nánétz'ó̜ó̜z” encodes information on number, subject, tense as well as location. What is even more interesting is that transitive verbs describing the same action can have different verb stems depending on the physical characteristics of the object. For example, the verb “consume” is /-yí̜í̜h/ when the object of consumption is unspecified, /-ˀaaɬ/ for consuming hard, compact objects like sweets and /-tsˀééh/ when consuming mushy matter.%0a%0aVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeWv1wmdzTY%0aVerb stems of consumption: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/15-Navajo-verb-stems-of-consumption-taken-from-Young-Morgan-1987-251-263-875_tbl2_278028506%0aNavajo grammar: https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/126385/azu_alc_cp_n16_9_34_w.pdf?sequence=1%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210514-044139-145250#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)
