However, no significant improvements were found for the sounds: /ɪ/, /æ/ and /ð/. As Bella said in her previous post, /ð/ is a sound that is non-existent in Catalan-spanish, but it is found in the English language. Therefore, it is not shocking that L2 speakers had a challenging time improving their pronunciation of this sound. I found it interesting that L2 speakers were able to improve their pronunciation of multiple vowel sounds as I believe that those sounds are more difficult to master.%0a%0aSource:%0aCarlet, A., & Cebrian, J.
