It is worthy to note that Cynthia says “Don’t want lah” before this. Using the particle “leh” casts the sentence in a more doubtful tone than “lah”, which suggests Cynthia is becoming more open to the idea of a blind date.%0a%0a2.“You think you still very young ah?” (Do you think that you’re still very young?)%0aIn this context, “ah” is used at the end of a question, to which the asker expects agreement. Cynthia’s friend is expecting her to agree that she is no longer young and should try out the blind date.%0a%0a3.“One more lah” and “Okay lah okay lah”%0aInterestingly, “lah” has two different meanings in the two sentences above. In the first sentence, the usage of “lah” is an appeal for understanding and it makes the tone of the sentence softer. This is similar to the example of “Can lah” in the article above. In the second sentence, “lah” conveys exasperation. This suggests Cynthia is agreeing to a blind date, albeit reluctantly. In general, “lah” is a highly flexible particle that has a variety of meanings in different contexts.%0a%0a4.“siao liao” (I must have gone crazy)%0a“liao” functions as a perfective aspect marker. It carries the meaning that something has happened/been done and it is loosely equivalent to “already” in Standardized American English.%0a%0a5.“dabao lor” (You can just bring packed food prepared at home)%0a“lor” is used to signal that something is obvious. In this case, Cynthia feels that it should be obvious that Robert would bring food from home to eat at work, rather than buy food from stores outside.%0aNote: “dabao” usually means order takeout from a restaurant or store, but it refers to bringing food prepared at home in this case.%0a%0aParticles in Singlish allow for a significant amount of flexibility in their usage and often take on completely different meanings in different contexts. However, I hope that the examples from the video and those in the article have provided insight into how particles change the tone of the sentence.
