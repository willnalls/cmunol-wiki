There are many different dialects of Kamang, with the main ones being Western Kamang, Upland Kamang, and Lowland Kamang. It has about 6,000 native speakers (as of 2014). Originally, the Kamang people lived in the central mountain region of Alor Island, however were forcibly resettled by the Indonesian government to move towards the coastal areas of the island. Kamang language and culture suffered immensely as a result of this migration, with a reported EGIDS level of 5-6a. This means while the language is not used in formal institutions, it is still the norm in community settings and at home, while also actively being taught and used by children. This rating might be generous, as many sources state that while Kamang might be spoken amongst parents and the elderly, children only have a passive understanding of Kamang and are much more inclined to respond and speak their local dialect of Malay. Moreover, Kamang is rarely taught to children as much. %0a%0ahttps://traveltomorrow.com/10-endangered-languages-that-risk-extinction/%0ahttps://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/9489%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/size-and-vitality/woi%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woisika_language#:~:text=Woisika%252C%2520also%2520known%2520as%2520Kamang,%252C%2520Watang%252C%2520Kamana%252DKamang.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)%0a(:Title: Kamang :)
