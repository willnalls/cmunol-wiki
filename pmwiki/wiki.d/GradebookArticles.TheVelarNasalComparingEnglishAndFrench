On WALS, there are 3 different feature values for categorizing based on the velar nasal. The first feature value is initial velar nasal, which means that the velar nasal can be found at the start of a word such as ŋoa in Swahili. The second feature value is no initial velar nasal, which means that the velar nasal is a consonant in a language but will never be at the start of a word. The last feature value is no velar nasal, which means that the velar nasal is not found in the language at all. %0a%0aEnglish and French differ with respect to the velar nasal because the velar nasal is a consonant present in English, just not initially, while the velar nasal is not present in French at all. One example of a velar nasal in English is the word "doing", which ends with a velar nasal.%0a%0aSomething I found interesting was that French was listed as a language with no velar nasal in WALS, but PHOIBLE classified it as a language that without a velar nasal in one inventory and with a velar nasal in another. According to Wikipedia, this could be because French sometimes borrows words from other language such as English that use the velar nasal. For example, French people say the word "camping", which ends in [ŋ]. So although [ŋ] is not a native consonant in any words of French origin, it ends up being used anyways through the use of words from other languages that French has adapted over time.%0a%0aSources:%0aGregory D.S.
