The Nacimeran people seem to associate the word “TRIP” with negative experiences. For example, the word is used to describe setting off an alarm or stumbling over one’s words, both of which can be interpreted as bad experiences.  Similarly, guilt TRIPs and power TRIPs describe actions that can be seen as negative. Using the word “TRIP” as an indicator, we can identify concepts or actions that the Nacimeran people view as negative. The Nacimeran people seem to frown upon recreational activities that involve travel. Drugs, exciting events or reminiscing about the past are also seen by them as something to be avoided. The Nacimeran people may also have negative connotations associated with goats and wildfowl in particular. Overall, the Nacimera seems to be a group of people that dislike travel and excitement.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
