However, given its structure of combining the word “insect” with the -oid suffix, one can easily infer that “insectoid” is a being with insect-like characteristics. The word shares similarities with the word “humanoid,” which is indeed listed in the OED. Interestingly, the relevant definition for “humanoid” in the OED defines the word as “an alien being having a similar physical form to a human” (1) in relation to science fiction.

The elaboration on the article demonstrates that “insectoid” not only has a well-understood definition but is also relevant to multiple different fields like robotics and extraterrestrial research.
