I always thought that sign language had to be acquired later in life than spoken languages, but after I read Sign Language: Acquisition by RI Mayberry and B Squires, University of California, I thought about it more and realized there was no reason why babies couldn't babble in sign language. In fact, the article states that babies learn to babble in sign language at the same time as spoken language, around 6 - 12 months.%0a%0aThe article details that babbling first occurs with handshapes like an open hand, meaning 5, or a closed hand, the letter A. These shapes are often repeated  and are accompanied with raising and lowering the arms and movement towards and away from the body.%0a%0aAfter babbling fades, children learning sign language engage in signing analogous to baby-talk. Just as a baby learning spoken language might pronounce words wrong in a way that's easier to say that their correct pronunciations, children learning sign language begin by simplifying signs to something they can produce. Additionally, these first words, just like spoken language, start with the things immediately around them and grow from there.%0a%0aIts interesting to see how similar sign language and spoken language are. I never knew they were so closely related. I'm interested in learning more about how the development of fine motor skills factors into sign language acquisition and whether it occurs at around the same time the capacity of language develops.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
