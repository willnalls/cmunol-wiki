It is one of the languages that is endangered according to Ethnologue; I was not able to access the official EGIDS classification of the language, but based on the descriptions of each EGIDS level, I would guess that the language is either EGIDS 6a or 6b. This is because the number of speakers of this language is very small compared to other languages of higher levels, and the language is closely tied to a community that tends to keep to themselves and is not as industrially developed as the surrounding communities.%0a%0aAdditionally, this community is somewhat geographically isolated, as they primarily reside in the hilly region in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. As increased development occurs over time, the language will likely be replaced by more institutional languages in the area (Tamil, Malayalam) which will allow Kanikkars to communicate and succeed in these new communities. I think one difference between Kanikkaran and many indigenous languages is that a lot of indigenous children stopped learning their mother tongue, for various reasons – their ancestors were sent to boarding schools where their native language was prohibited, English better suited the environment and enabled them to succeed, etc. However, Kanikkar children continue to learn their language, and because of its similarities with other regional languages, they are not at a severe disadvantage in the surrounding community (i.e., they may still be able to understand Tamil and Malayalam). Although the number of speakers of the language may be few, the Kannikar community will continue to pass on their language and culture for generations to come.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210418-184159-526240#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Additional information on the Kanikkaran language %0a-> - xiranw%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI came across this amazing paper by Dr. Syam S.K. titled "Aspects of Life and Language of Kanikkar Tribal Community of Kerala – A Study".

For example, even in central-west India where Hindi and Marathi are the most spoken languages, there are communities of people  who speak isolated and endangered languages. For example, near the border of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh there are people of the Korku tribe, who speak an Austroasiatic language (700,000 speakers) related more closely to more east Indian tribal languages. The Nihali people also live alongside the Korku, traditionally working as farm laborers for people outside their community. The Nihali language is endangered with only 2,500 speakers. It borrows most of its vocabulary from the neighboring languages, but otherwise it's an isolate language (no language family). Some people say it's only used today to prevent people from outside the community from understanding them. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-210127-89900#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: D:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)
