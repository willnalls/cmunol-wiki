She is a Canadian-born Punjabi creator, and it meant a lot to viewers to have Indian representation in media that people enjoyed watching.  She typically made rant and skit videos with themes like "Types of kids at school", "Types of teachers at school", "Every argument with my parents ever", a lot of issues that viewers in middle school could relate to and get a laugh from.  She also had videos that were based on her Indian and Canadian backgrounds like "The difference between brown and white girls", "How white people listen to Indian music", and "What Canadians really want to say to Americans".  One of the main ways she would incorporate her Indian heritage was by dressing up as her parents in traditional Indian clothes like saris and turbans, wearing wigs and makeup, and taking on an over-the-top Indian accent to play them as a role for comedic effect (this is caused by how one of the characteristics of many Indian languages is a lack of alveolar stops and instead the presence of both dental and retroflex stops), and it is seen as criticizing Indian English.  She also uses many references from Black and Caribbean cultures in her videos, taking on those accents and using their slang, and also wearing cornrows or box braids.  For a while, she seemed to get away with it because she's a POC and grew up in a diverse area knowing how to use these terms properly, but people are coming out with how they feel like it was all very offensive.%0aRecently, she posted a video of herself singing “Badman Forward, Badman Pull Up” by dancehall and reggae artist Ding Dong while taking on a Caribbean accent.  People started pointing out how this is cultural appropriation because she is not Caribbean and she doesn't have an accent (this accent and dialect has many characteristics, some of the most notable ones being h-dropping and th-stopping), so she is seen as criticizing Caribbean English.%0aHere is a link to the Instagram post: https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fuNMqnm3z/?utm_source=ig_embed%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210504-203428-932570#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Where is the line %0a-> - BrandonN%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI have never heard of Lilly Singh but I can relate to other content creators who also mock their own culture. Although POC seem to enjoy lighthearted jokes of their own culture, is there a line where it is wrong to do this?

I have seen many content creators and also personally know people who mimic their culture but it seems harmless. I find the lighthearted jokes about my own race to be humorous when brought up by someone who shares the same background.
