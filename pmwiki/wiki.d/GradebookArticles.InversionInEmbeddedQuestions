For example, consider the question “What time is it?” Here, this question is the main clause of the sentence, but an example of this question as an embedded question would be “He doesn’t know what time it is”. %0a%0aIn Standard American English, questions exhibit flipping of the subject and auxiliary verb: “it is 4pm” becomes “what time is it” to form a question. However, this flipping does not occur when forming embedded questions. In the example above, the subject-auxiliary word order in the question is “is it” but in the embedded question is “it is”.%0a%0aHowever, in dialects of English which have inversion in embedded questions, this word order is the same between questions and embedded questions, specifically that it follows the word order of the question. Taking the previous example, some dialects of English would say “He doesn’t know what time is it”. %0a%0aOne thing to note about embedded question inversion is that a complementizer, such as if or whether, is not allowed when a question exhibits inversion. For example, consider the Standard American sentence “He’s wondering whether the test is today.” The inverted sentence “He’s wondering is the test today” is acceptable, but the sentence “He’s wondering whether is the test today” is not because a complementizer and inversion cannot occur in the same sentence. %0a%0aSource: https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/inversion-embedded-questions %0a %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
