One big part of sign language is non-manual markers which includes facial expressions. You brought up a good point about how covid can impart sign language. More specifically, the use of face masks hides facial expressions that people make when expressing language. More than just providing context, facial expressions is a part of sign language, meaning without the use of facial expressions, people may not be able to communicate with each other. In addition, children are not able to fully master non-manual markers such as facial expressions until 12 years of age (even though they start using them at 2 years of age). This means that children may develop the language at a slower rate if they cannot see the facial expressions others are making. %0a%0aSource:%0aMayberry, R. I., & Squires, B. (2006).
