There are four different classes of consonants, all of them occur in around 10%25 or less of all languages.

There is no word which has the pronunciation 'th'. This means when German speakers speak English, they do not tend to say the sound correctly. Instead, when 'th' is voiced, they use d instead. For example th-at becomes d-at. Also when 'th' is voiceless, they may use z or s instead, like th-anks becomes s-anks.

It is interesting how certain sounds can be non-existent in languages even if they are right next to each other. For instance, besides Spanish, no other Western European country has the dental fricative. This creates the question, why are certain sounds used in some languages and not others?
