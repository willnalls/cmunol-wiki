This combination of the physical features of the actor/actress and the accent is proposed to give the character a specific stereotypical image. %0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aSource: https://www.dailyo.in/arts/the-simpsons-big-bang-theory-goodness-gracious-me-stereotyping-indians-dont-understand-theres-no-indian-english-accent/story/1/25744.html%0a%0aIn modern American television shows, we often see certain characters who represent a certain stereotypical persona of a minority group in the United States. In this article, I will specifically talk about the "Indian American English." From the article, we see that major examples of such characters with "Indian American English" are: The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory. I would like to note that the article suggests that there is no such thing as "Indian American English" and that it is only an accent. %0a%0aThere are two common traits of the Indian American English accent. The first being: The [d] and [t] are two sounds that are primarily pronounced too far back in the mouth. Since the [d] and [t] sound do not exist in Indian languages, speakers often have to figure out how to properly pronounce the sound, and it is usually personified as a retroflex plosive. This is a criticism of the application of consonant substitution. Another example would be: the softening of the [r] sound. Comedians who carry out these roles often replace the r with variations: an alveolar tap [ɾ], a retroflex flap [ɽ], or an alveolar trill [r] based on the influence by the native phonology. This is also a criticism of the application of consonant substitution. %0a%0aAs stated earlier, I am not sure if this is really a dialect of English, but it is surely an accent. The criticized variants of the Indian American English accent is often stemming from the substitution of native American English consonants to other variations that is heavily influenced by the native phonologies of Indian languages. According to Wikipedia, the Indian government officially recognized 23 different languages spoken in India. Due to the wider population of Hindi speakers, the Indian American English personified in major American television series are often tailored towards a Hindi American English accent.%0a%0aFrom the source, I found that the usage of such characters and their attempt of mimicking the accent is often a comedic relief tool that pokes fun of Indian stereotypes. (Note: Triggering Statements) In The Simpsons, the character Apu is a corner shop owner who immigrated to the Unites States. In The Big Bang Theory, Rajesh Koothrappali is an astrophysicist who has selective mutism. In both examples, we can see that the shows personifies Indians as corner shop owners or exceptionally smart individuals with certain disabilities. Thus, the show masks English speakers with Indian language accents as these specific facades. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210421-092856-84100#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Indian Intonation %0a-> - EthanW%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI agree with you that Indian accent in TV shows is usually used for comedic effects. In addition to using phonemes that are characteristic in Indian languages (in particular Hindi), comedians also mimic the Indian intonation very often. Because at phonological level many other languages do not have alveolar plosives [d] and [t] or have retroflex flap [ɽ] just as Hindi, in my opinion using Indian intonation plays greater role in reinforcing stereotypes of Indian accent and even the language speakers. %0a%0aFor those who are interested in Indian intonation, please refer to this paper for more details: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281600861_The_intonation_of_Indian_languages_An_areal_phenomenon%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210421-092856-84100#%0a#foxbegin 210424-043144-274900#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Plosives in Indian Languages %0a-> - nithyas%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think the "creation" of an Indian accent in TV shows by pronouncing the [d] and [t] sounds further back in the mouth than the conventional sounds in Standard American English is an interesting phenomenon that mimics the Indian accent pretty well.%0a%0aHowever, as a native speaker of an Indian language (Tamil), I want to potentially push back on this idea that the [d] and [t] sounds do not exist in Indian languages (at least in the same way they exist in American English, which is the alveolar or dental plosive). You mention that typically, the [d] and [t] sounds in Indian dialects of English involve pronouncing the consonant further back in the sound, and this is largely due to the fact that the [d] and [t] sounds in Indian languages are typically pronounced further back in the mouth. I think this is certainly true, and can think of numerous examples ("dabba" - box, "kadavul" - god, etc.), but I'm not sure if the claim that alveolar and dental plosives cease to exist altogether is true. The reason for this is there are many words I can think of where my natural pronunciation of the [d] or [t] sound in the word is in fact alveolar and not further back ("pattasu" - firework, "padam" - movie). However, I'm not entirely sure if this is a consequence of my own pronunciation, and it is worth noting that the pronunciations of the words I listed are not audibly altered if they are pronounced as retroflex rather than alveolar. Additionally, it is hard to verify by looking up transcriptions for these words since the scripts for these languages are different, so you may very well be correct, but it is definitely an interesting thing to think about.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210424-043144-274900#%0a#foxbegin 210425-034715-255610#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Further examples of stereotypical Indian characters %0a-> - shreya_r%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aIn addition to the examples of The Big Bang Theory and The Simpsons, characters who speak in stereotypical and overexaggerated Indian accents are also seen in the shows Jessie and Phineas and Ferb. In both shows, the Indian characters (Ravi and Baljeet) are portrayed as extremely nerdy overachievers who are constantly picked on, and they speak with the same heavy accent that was described in this article. This further perpetuates the stereotypes that were brought up here of Indians being intellectual but weak/socially awkward. Since both of these shows had audiences that were primarily children, they allowed these stereotypes to be ingrained into kids at a young age, and then those same stereotypes would be reinforced in shows targeted at older audiences such as the ones described in this article. Furthermore, at least in my experience, these kinds of characters were often the only kind of representation South Asians got in media while growing up.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210425-034715-255610#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210501-060208-3560#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-30.04.2021 - 23:02-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210501-060208-3560 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!Abi_S%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Indian Accents in media'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aThe accents (the portrayal of them as super smart of corner shop owners) definitely helps to strengthen stereotypes associated with accents. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210501-060208-3560#%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: D:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
