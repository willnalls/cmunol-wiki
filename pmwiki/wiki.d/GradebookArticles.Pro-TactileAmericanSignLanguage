To get around this, deafblind people have had to use either their own modified versions of ASL, Braille, or fingerspelling to communicate. However, as groups of once-isolated deafblind people started to meet each other and form groups, it was clear that another form of communication was needed. With regular ASL or fingerspelling, interpreters are needed to facilitate the communication between each of the deafblind people. %0a%0aPro-tactile ASL is different from regular ASL in that many ASL signs are adapted for use through touch, and some entirely new signs have been created. For example, a new PASL sign is a tap on the arm, meaning a "nod." This "nod" is meant as a form of backchanneling, where small acknowledgments are passed back from the listener to the speaker to indicate that the listener is understanding. In typical ASL this is communicated through conventional means, such as nodding or looking at the speaker, but deafblind people cannot use these methods to communicate. An additional feature of PASL is the capability for multiple people to have a conversation at once. Typical PASL signs are designed such that multiple listeners can touch the speaker's hands at once to join in on the conversation. Each listener can each tap back on the speaker's body to illustrate that they are listening, as well. %0a%0aSources: %0ahttp://www.protactile.org%0a- protactile.org has some interesting videos of pro-tactile sign language with transcripts if you want to gain a further understanding%0a%0ahttps://www.perkins.org/stories/how-pro-tactile-american-sign-language-ptasl-is-changing-the-conversation%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
