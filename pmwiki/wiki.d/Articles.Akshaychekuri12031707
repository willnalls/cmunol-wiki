However, more recent trends indicate that this number may be much lower. Furthermore, many of those counted as "speakers" are more so passive speakers. The primary cause of this decline was initially discrimination of the Mapuche people and discouragement of them using their native language by colonizers. In a sense, this continues in the modern day as Mapudungun has yet to be recognized as an official language in either Chile or Argentina despite being the dominant language of the region for centuries. Since it has never been an official language, it hasn't entered the curriculum of schools and thus essentially the only way the language is preserved is through home languages. However, many of the remaining households of Mapudungun speakers are small-scale farmers and in an increasingly urbanized world, the number of such households is decreasing each year.%0a%0a%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche_language%0ahttps://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Mapudungun.html%0ahttps://www.academia.edu/3234126%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: D:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Mapudungun:)
