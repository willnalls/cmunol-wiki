Many words have both forms, depending on dialect, speaker, and phase of the moon. The distribution of these forms is currently changing, with spelling pronunciation and generalization playing big roles. But what is the reason this morphological alternation exists at all? In Old English, there was only one series of fricatives, and it was quite naturally voiced between voiced sounds and voiceless elsewhere. Due to the influx of loanwords in Middle English, voiced and voiceless fricatives became distinct phonemes, but the alternation between them in pluralization remained. In this instance, changes in phonology become an instance of irregularity in morphology.%0a%0aAnother type of irregular plural is the umlaut plural, which involves changing the vowel within a word.%0a%0afoot		/fʊt/		feet		/fiːt/%0amouse		/maʊs/		mice		/maɪs/%0agoose		/guːs/		geese		/giːs/%0a%0aThese plurals exhibit an Old English sound change called umlaut, where, for certain nouns, internal vowels become fronted when followed at some distance by /i/ or /j/. Later, the /i/ or /j/ disappeared as English evolved, but the vowel change remained. This process happens in other Germanic languages, and in fact is much more common there. As before, changes in phonology become an instance of irregularity in morphology. %0a%0aThe last case of irregular plurals I will examine are the Latin declension-based plurals in general.%0a%0aantenna		/æntɛnǝ/	antennae	/æntɛnaɪ/, /æntɛneɪ/%0aradius		/ɹeɪdiəs/	radii		/ɹeɪdiaɪ/%0aindex		/ɪndɛks/	indices		/ɪndɪsiːz/%0a%0aThe historical reasons for this are clear: Latin loanwords originally inflected differently, and they kept their original inflection patterns after being loaned. This mechanism is completely different from the other cases. %0a%0aOf course, not every word has just one plural. Any word will be understood as a plural if the regular suffix is used. There are complex interactions between regularity and patterns in the irregular forms, too. Generalization may apply the regular suffix to words that normally take irregular forms, but it may also go the other direction. One infamous example is “octopus”, which pluralizes to “octopuses” according to many prescriptivist sources (due to its Greek origins), but rather to “octopi” according to many speakers generalizing Latin forms. Another process is back-formation, where a plural form might produce a novel singular form. I heard this especially often in my class 21241 Matrices and Transformations last semester, where classmates surprisingly often made the singular of “matrices” to be “matrice” /meɪtɹɪsiː/.%0a%0aAll these processes that are going on now will likely contribute to regularity and irregularity of English plurals in future versions of English. The phonological changes might also create new irregularities. Language change is a constant process, and the way we speak is changing as we speak.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: Varia:)%0a(:if authgroup @tas:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]]%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!Varia]]%0a%0a!Irregular Plurals, Historical Linguistics, and Regularization%0a%0a:Author: Russell_E%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aIn this article, I analyze English plurals, addressing some of the historical basis behind irregular morphology and some of the current changes in morphology.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aThe morphological process I’ll be discussing is pluralization in English.
