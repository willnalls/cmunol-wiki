The WALS database categorizes the velar nasal into three different groups: initial velar nasal (velar nasal can start a word), no initial velar nasal (velar nasal can’t start the word, but can be in the word), and no velar nasal (velar nasal is not found in the language). The PHOIBLE database only classifies a language as either having, or not having, the velar nasal. %0a%0aEnglish is categorized as no initial velar nasal so [ŋ] can’t start a word in the English language, but it can appear in a word. A few examples of words in English that have a velar nasal are: “English” and “ping”. In contrast, the velar nasal is not found in the Spanish language. The PHOIBLE database confirms that English is a language that uses the velar nasal, but Spanish is not.%0a%0aI found it very interesting that even though the official Spanish language, Castilian, does not use the velar nasal there are certain Spanish languages, such as Catalan, that do occasionally use the velar nasal. Catalan Spanish pairs the velar nasal with “-saŋ”. This leads me to question whether it is common for there to be these variations within different versions of a language. For example, is it common for Castilian Spanish to use a sound, but Catalan Spanish to not use the sound at all? %0a%0aTo attempt to answer my own question, I briefly read through the wiki post by Bella R, which compared uncommon consonants in English and Catalan and found that Castilian Spanish uses a “th” sound, but Catalan Spanish uses a “c” sound instead. This leads me to believe that this phenomenon might actually be a more common occurrence than I had previously thought.%0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://wals.info/chapter/9 %0a%0ahttps://phoible.org/parameters/941ED37AAF5E9C4E1B40D85008C6B2D9#1/32/150 %0a%0ahttp://cv.uoc.edu/annotation/f7cc99c3579514100285795cb537fbe8/675434/PID_00249319/PID_00249319.html %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210513-195210-661350#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-13.05.2021 - 12:52-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210513-195210-661350 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!saumyaB%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Why does the velar nasal appear in Catalan?'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aI am very interested about why the velar nasal appears in Catalan?
