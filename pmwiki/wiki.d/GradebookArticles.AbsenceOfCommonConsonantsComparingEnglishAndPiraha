In Piraha, this absence is extreme. There are only eight consonants compared to 21 in English. Piraha contains only the velar, bilabial, alveolar, and glottal plosives; the alveolar fricative [s]; and the glottal fricative [h]. %0a%0aSince Piraha has so few consonants there are fewer ways to combine them to create words that describe things. However, Piraha is spoken by only about 300 monolingual people in their native land so they do not need the flexibility that more consonants provides. In contrast, English needs all of the consonants it has because people use it much more generally.%0a%0aBecause speakers of Piraha are severely constrained by the low number of common consonants, it provides evidence for the theory of linguistic relativity. Linguistic relativity "is a principle suggesting that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language" (Wikipedia).%0a%0aMy question is how could you accurately determine that the language of group of speakers affects their world view. What tests could you run that measure one's perceptions of the world? Even among people who speak the same language, there is significant variation in what is considered true or right, so how could you isolate other variables that can also affect one's worldview?%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
