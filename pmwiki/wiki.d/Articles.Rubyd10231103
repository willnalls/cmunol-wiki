There is no singular origin point for the phrase, and its region of usage is debated, though there are multiple accounts of it being common in New Jersey, USA. The most common hypothesis that ties the varied environments of the construct together is the theory that "open/close the light" is a metaphrase (a direct translation from another language) (2). This is seemingly supported by case studies of some particular dialects, notably Quebecois, in which the English "open the light" phrase can be directly traced from French's literal "ouvre la lumiere" (3). However, there are some dialects for which this theory is opposed, such as in Russian, wherein direct translation for the Russian phrase of the same meaning has more similarities with "turn on/off" than with "open/close"(1).%0a%0a1. https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/21318/close-the-light-regionalism-or-mere-oddity#comment178624_21318%0a2. https://usingaborrowedlanguage.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/open-the-light/%0a3. https://ask.metafilter.com/9204/Regional-Linguistics%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221102-004830-165210#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Open or Close the Lights in the Context of Chinese %0a-> - stanleyp2r%0a-> [-01.11.2022 - 17:48-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221102-004830-165210 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI can personally relate to the substitution between "turn on/off" and "close/open."

This construction is also the same in Cantonese with the same written words. One explanation for this construction is that ancient China's main lighting system was through oil lamps which were filled with oil and then lit to slowly burn through a wick. In order to turn off this light source, one had to physically turn a knob on the oil lamp to close the valve (kind of similar to a bunsen burner). This would separate the wick from the rest of the oil which would stop the light source. Thus, the verb "close" could have been used to mean "close the valve" or effectively "turn off the lights". Over time with the introduction of electricity-powered lighting systems, they might have continued to use this construction to indicate turning on and off lights.%0a%0aFurther, I'd like to draw attention to another example where multiple words can translate into the same meaning in another language. In Mandarin and Cantonese, 穿 (chuan1) and 带 (dai4) can both be used to mean the verb "to wear". In general, 带 is used for accessories like glasses, jewelry, face masks, hats, and wristwatches while 穿 is used for everything else including shirts, pants, socks, shoes, jackets, etc. I find it interesting that there are diversities between English and Cantonese for words to indicate subtle differences in meaning that aren't present in the other language and wonder how this distinction in English and Cantonese compare to those of other languages.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221119-040315-682210#%0a#foxbegin 221119-045238-957680#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Other languages that exhibit this %0a-> - gtwei%0a-> [-18.11.2022 - 20:52-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221119-045238-957680 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThere are a few other languages that use the same word for opening something (physical) and turning on the lights.

The most common hypothesis that ties the varied environments of the construct together is the theory that "open/close the light" is a metaphrase (a direct translation from another language) (2). This is seemingly supported by case studies of some particular dialects, notably Quebecois, in which the English "open the light" phrase can be directly traced from French's literal "ouvre la lumiere" (3). However, there are some dialects for which this theory is opposed, such as in Russian, wherein direct translation for the Russian phrase of the same meaning has more similarities with "turn on/off" than with "open/close"(1).%0a%3c %0a%3c 1. https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/21318/close-the-light-regionalism-or-mere-oddity#comment178624_21318%0a%3c 2. https://usingaborrowedlanguage.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/open-the-light/%0a%3c 3. https://ask.metafilter.com/9204/Regional-Linguistics%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#contentends]]%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expansions:%0a%3c [[#expansions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#expansionsend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c You must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%3c %0a%3c (:else:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Comments%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a%3c !!Change article category%0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:Section: A:)%0a%3c (:Category: MorphosyntacticDiversityOfEnglish:)%0a%3c (:Title: Open or Close the Lights:)%0a
