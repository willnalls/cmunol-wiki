If the pitch change is throughout the syllable, then it is a specific type of tone called a contour tone. Tone should not be confused with intonation; tone is for syllables while intonation is for collections of syllables (sentences/phrases). %0a    There are 3 types of tone systems: no tones, simple tones, and complex tones. In no tone systems, syllable meanings don’t change with different tones. Simple tone systems have 2 tone options to change the meanings of syllables. And complex tone systems have more than 2 tone options.%0a    English is a no tone system, while Hakka is a complex tone system with 4-5 tones. I think the most interesting difference between the two languages is how speakers know what a word or syllable means. In English, there are multiple words that are pronounced the same way (ex: two, too, to) so speakers infer the word’s meaning from the context of the sentence. But in Hakka, the meaning of the words change with their tones, so speakers don’t need to rely on the rest of the sentence to know that word was said. This makes me wonder if speakers who learn complex tone languages (and can’t distinguish the tones) continue to infer the meaning of words based on their contexts, and how well it works for them.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
