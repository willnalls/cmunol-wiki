In 2017, its EGID level was a 6b marking it as an endangered language though less severe. While Oyrat is still widely used in the older population, it is not being passed down. Most children in these populations can barely understand Oyrat let alone speak it. Thus, Oyrat is slowly being phased out in exchange for local languages such as Mandarin, Russian, and Mongolian.%0a%0aOyrat has declined over the past few decades for varying reasons. The education system in Mongolia was reformed in 1982 with Chakhar as its standardized language so Oyrat stopped being taught in classrooms. In Russia, a large portion of the population was deported or killed due to political conflict and the remaining individuals were forced to integrate into a majority-Russian population. As a result, the elderly are fluent in Oyrat while the children only have basic comprehension skills. Finally, the Chinese government imposed policies aimed to decrease nomadism by adopting Southern Mongolian as its official language. In addition, changes to the education system resulted in many Mongolian schools shutting down further reducing children's exposure to the language. Numerous programs led by influential Oyrat teachers have been initiated to help revive the language. In addition to teaching Oyrat to children in classrooms, these programs also hold annual music and dance performances as well as theatre productions in Oyrat to teach children about their language and culture. During 2019, the Festival of Oirat Peoples was held in Kalmykia to connect people of the same background. Through such efforts, the decline in number of speakers has slowed significantly but much work is still required to stabilize the language.%0a%0ahttps://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3260%0ahttps://hlt.bme.hu/en/dld/language/1393%0ahttps://festival.si.edu/2013/one-world-many-voices/language-communities/kalmyk/smithsonian%0ahttps://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/295417?show=full%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: D:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)%0a(:Title: Endangered Oyrat Language:)
