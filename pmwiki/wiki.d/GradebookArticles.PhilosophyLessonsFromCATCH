You can CATCH a ball, CATCH a movie, CATCH a glimpse, CATCH a cold or even CATCH fire (hopefully never). I hope you CAUGHT on because other things can also catch you. A jump scare can CATCH you by surprise, a book can CATCH your imagination and a news headline can CATCH your eye. CATCH can even be used as a noun. Fishermen want a good CATCH of fish, singles want to find a good CATCH and you sure wouldn’t CATCH a huntsman going around without a safety CATCH on their rifle. Now, I should probably CATCH myself before I get carried away but if you’re going to play a prank, don’t get CAUGHT or you’re really going to CATCH it. Now that we’ve seen this amazing word as both a verb, noun and verb --- wait, did you CATCH the name of that CATCHY song? Because I only remember CATCHES of it!%0a%0a%0aDespite the various meanings in the polysemy of the word “catch”, the concept of “possession” seems to permeate the usage of the word. It seems that the Nacirema people believe in being proactive and dominant because the usage of “catch” often revolves around something taking control of another. An exception to the concept of dominance would be “caught”, which is used passively. However, it is worthy to note that the passive form “caught” seems to have far fewer variations in meaning than the active form “catch”, which suggests the idea of proactivity and dominance is still more prominent in Narcireman culture.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
