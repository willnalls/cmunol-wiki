Tonal languages are languages in which different meanings can be created through using different tones of voice.

In tonal languages tone actually serves to distinguish words from one another. %0a%0aThe English language has no tone system whereas the Latvian language employs a simple tone system with three tones called the level tone, the broken tone and the falling tone.  Latvian has what is considered a simple tone system because only long syllables and diphthong can have a tone which contrasts complex tonal languages in which every syllable receives a tone. Additionally, this contrasts English in which tone does not affect the meaning of words at all. A common example of the use of tone in Latvian is the word “Zāle”. When the ‘a’ is spoken with a falling tone, the word means grass. If a level tone is used, zāle means hall. Finally, zāles, spoken with a broken tone, means drugs. %0a%0aOne question I am curious about is the relationship between intonation and tone in languages.
