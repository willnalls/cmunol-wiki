Certainly, it's a simple fact that having fewer consonants and/ or vowels in a language limits the amount of possible sounds that can be produced. However, to circumvent this issue, users of a language can simply combine the sounds they do have in ways that wouldn't be valid in other languages.%0a%0aIn the document I link at the bottom, even a brief skim will show that in the Oneida language, there are a lot of combinations of consonants that would seem quite strange to us. For example, they have as options "ka", "klo", and "kwa", among many other examples that would be valid in English. However, they also have combinations like "kha", "kna","khya", and many more that would be against the rules of English.%0a%0aOn top of this, there are many aspects of language beyond the valid sounds themselves that go into creating meaning. A commonly known example is the use of pitch in mandarin. Specific to Oneida though, they have a far more complex system of stress than we're accustomed to in English, and they are also quite unique in making use of whispering in their language (for purposes beyond gossip). From the document I've been referring to, "Most words have two pronunciations depending on where%0athey occur in a sentence. Words that occur with other words immediately after them in%0athe same sentence have no whispering. But when those same words occur at the end of a%0asentence or when spoken in isolation, then the last syllable is typically whispered. Such%0awhispering is indicated in the writing system by underlining.
