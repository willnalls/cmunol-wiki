For example, in Mandarin Chinese, 马 means "horse", while 妈 means "mother". Both words are pronounced using the syllable "ma", but they have different tones. %0a%0aIn particular, 马 is pronounced with what speakers call the third tone, which is when the pitch goes down, then up during pronunciation. 妈 is pronounced with the first tone, which is when the pitch remains constant throughout the syllable. Varying pitch in this way enables tonal languages to have many more meanings per syllable. It should be noted, however, that two different words in Mandarin Chinese can still sound exactly the same (including tone). %0a%0aWALS makes a further distinction within the tonal languages. Some are classified as having a simple tone system, where others have a complex tone system. Some languages with a simple tone system are classified as such because they have only two distinct tones. Other languages with a simple tone system are classified as such because the presence of tonality is disputed; some researchers attribute differences in pronunciation to tone, while others assert that it is syllable stress or length. All tonal languages not classified as simple have a complex tone system. There are four (or five, when we count the neutral tone) well-documented tones in Mandarin Chinese, so WALS classifies it as a language with a complex tone system. English, on the other hand, has no tones. %0a%0aI wonder if the presence of tones in a language makes it harder to learn for native English speakers. I grew up speaking English and Marathi, two atonal languages. I learned Spanish, another atonal language, in elementary school, and Mandarin Chinese, a tonal language, in high school. I found Spanish pronunciation much easier to grasp, mostly because of the fact that the tones in Mandarin Chinese (especially the first two of four) are difficult for my ear to distinguish. Now, in my case, this perceived disparity in difficulty could be due to the fact that it's much easier to learn a language when one is a small child than when one is a teenager. But it still makes sense that learning a language with features that one isn’t familiar with would present a greater challenge, all other things being equal. %0a%0aSources:%0a%0aIan Maddieson. 2013.

For Mandarin Chinese, differences in pitch imply different words, yet there are inherent differences in pitch when singing a musical melody. This is unlike in English, where singers can change the pitch of the words without changing the meaning of the song. Therefore, is there any difficulty in understanding Mandarin Chinese lyrics in songs, and how do Mandarin Chinese singers reconcile any conflict in pitch between the lyrics and musical melody?%0a%0aThe article I found identified certain patterns in melody and tone in Mandarin folk songs. For example, if the first note is higher than the second note, the syllable on the first note bears tone 1 or tone 2, while the syllable on the second note can bear any tone. %0a%0aThe article also suggests that in accented positions in the melody (such as the first beat of a 4/4 time signature), the syllable (known as the head) is more prominent than other syllables in the same measure. The author suggests that the tone of this syllable must be preserved by the melody, either by the notes representing that syllable or notes to the left and right of the syllable.%0a%0aHowever, the article also concedes that word recognition in song is more difficult than in speech, with ambiguity in certain syllables, especially if they are non-head syllables. The author suggests that semantic and syntactic cues, such as common phrases, help listeners identify the lyrics. %0a%0aReferences:%0aWee, Lian-Hee. (2007).

Apparently, historically speech recognition programs have forgone tracking pitch at all when recognizing speech, instead relying on word length and assuming that this tends to correlate well with the pitch the user is speaking in. An example they give in English is with 'inCLINE' vs 'inCLINE'. This was done because little to no gains had been demonstrated in using pitch, aside from the occasional system which tailored itself purely to one language.%0a%0aHowever, the researchers in this article, through a deep neural network, were able to utilize pitch and tonal features to dramatically improve tonal language recognition, and even slightly improve recognition for non-tonal languages. The exact setup is a little hard to follow, particularly because they frequently reference models and results from other papers, but the overall findings presented at the end are hopeful, and the conclusion sums up the research well.%0a%0ahttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/fmetze/interACT//Publications_files/publications/babel-tonal.pdf%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210227-203015-554630#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210506-112333-884540#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-06.05.2021 - 04:23-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210506-112333-884540 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!xiranw%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Funny video about learning Mandarin tones'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rb528mMWJM %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210506-112333-884540#%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)
