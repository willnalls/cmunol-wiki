I am more used to navigating intonation, which can change the meaning of sentences rather than words. For example, in class, we looked at the example, "GIOVANNI said that Olga went to the store" vs "Giovanni said that OLGA went to the store" (I'm using caps for italics). In this example, its clear that the important information, such as the answer to the question of "Who said that Olga went to the store?" or "Who went to the store?" is emphasized.

Meaning is emphasized and conveyed, respectively, by the sound of the speaker. Tone seems like a continuation of intonation in this way. In considering how languages develop, I wonder whether intonation progressed into tone systems in tonal languages, intonation developed from tone, or if the two progressed independently of each other.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
