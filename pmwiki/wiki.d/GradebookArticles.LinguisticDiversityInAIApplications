However, she found that Siri could not understand her Russian accent at all, making her purchase completely useless. Over time, it seems that the developers of Siri became aware of this oversight and have made a lot of progress in adapting their program for many linguistic backgrounds.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
