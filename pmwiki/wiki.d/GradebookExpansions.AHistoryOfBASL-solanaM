Although BASL has been historically overlooked by scholars and often assumed to be a lesser version of modern ASL, more recent scholarly research suggests the BASL is actually closer to early ASL, which was heavily influenced by French sign language, than contemporary ASL is. One explanation for this is that in the 1870s and 80s, deaf schools for white students pushed students to learn to speak and lip-read rather than focusing on signing, thus Black signers retained the standards of ASL that were lost to many white deaf communities. In fact, many white signing teachers ended up moving to Black deaf schools to teach signing because of this. The article also discusses how it is common for signers of BASL to switch between BASL and ASL depending on the context, similar to how speakers of BVE switch between BVE and Standard American English in different contexts.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
