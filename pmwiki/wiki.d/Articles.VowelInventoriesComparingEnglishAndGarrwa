The ‘vowel inventories’ category is comprised of three different values: ‘small vowel inventory’, which indicates a language with only 2-4 vowel contrasts; ‘average vowel inventory’, which indicates a language with 5-6 vowel contrasts; and ‘large vowel inventory’, which indicates a language with 7-14 vowel contrasts.%0a%0aEnglish falls into the ‘large vowel inventory’ category with around 15 different vowel contrasts, while Garrwa falls into the ’small vowel inventory’ category with only around 3 vowel contrasts.
