Early English settlers in New Zealand learned Māori (1), but as Europeans became the majority around the 1860s, English became the dominant language. Children were encouraged to speak English in the community and some were even punished for speaking Māori in schools. More Māori people also began moving from rural communities to cities, where English was widely spoken, particularly during World War 2 (2). In the 1930s, 96%25 of Māori families spoke the Māori language. By the 1960s, only 26%25 still spoke it. %0a%0aIn 1972, a petition was presented to the New Zealand Parliament to have the Māori language and culture taught in schools. New Zealand also established Māori language week in the 1970s and made Māori an official language in 1987. Particularly over the last couple of decades, the use of Māori has become normalized in New Zealand with presenters speaking in Māori on television and candy and peanut butter companies adding Māori to their product labels (3). Particularly over the last decade, interest in learning Māori has grown among young people, both Māori and non-Māori. Between 2018 and 2022, the proportion of people able to speak "more than a few words or phrases" of Māori rose from 24%25 to 30%25. %0a%0aHowever, some experts have concerns that the widespread interest in the Māori language might actually be harming revival efforts. A recently-published study, which compared Māori to Welsh (a language that has successfully reversed its decline in Wales) argued that Māori might be on a "pathway towards extinction" and that Māori education should be prioritized for Māori children to avoid stretching the limited pool of qualified Māori teachers too thin (4). %0a%0a(1) https://te-pa-tu.com/our-stories/the-fascinating-history-of-new-zealands-native-language/%0a(2) https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/history-of-the-maori-language%0a(3) https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/09/m-ori-language-week-expert-says-new-zealand-doing-better-than-rest-of-world-at-revitalising-protecting-indigenous-language.html%0a(4) https://time.com/5922833/new-zealand-maori-language/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221103-182008-619990#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Māori language %0a-> - hyunsunb%0a-> [-03.11.2022 - 11:20-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221103-182008-619990 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe Māori language has a distinctive aspect of the language where there are long and short vowels.
