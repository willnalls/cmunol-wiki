The Mapuche were the original stewards of a wide territory in the southern cone from the west coast in Chile to the east coast in Argentina. The collective name of the tribe is Mapuche, but Mapuches call themselves by different names depending on where they live. "For example the Huilliche, people from the south, the Lafkenche, people from the west or the Nagche, people of the valley." There is no preferred name. The IPA transcription of "Mapuche" is: [maput͡ʃe].%0a%0aOne important treaty in the land is the 1993 Indigenous Act, Ley Indígena, which provides "protection, promotion and development of the indigenous groups in Chile."%0aThe law prevents the government or a company from forcing indigenous people from their land without compensation. However, if the government or company provides a piece of land of equal value then a transfer can take place. But only if both groups agree to the deal.%0a%0aThere are about 1.3 million Mapuches living in South America although there used to be many more. Also, there are no significant reclamation efforts underway or pedagogical resources for learning the language, Mapudungun. This is because in Chile's rigid class structure, Mapuches are seen as the lowest class. Because of this, it is not uncommon for Mapuches to change their names to sound Chilean, or for parents to not teach their children Mapudungun.%0a%0aBecause of this, in urban areas Mapudungun is spoken mostly ceremoniously during cultural celebrations involving dancing and music. There is still a stigma associated with being Mapuche.%0a%0aOnly in rural areas where the Mapuche live in relatively isolated reserves is Mapundungun spoken in daily life.%0a%0aAlthough there are many Mapuches living in South America, there is no reliable information about how many speakers there are.
