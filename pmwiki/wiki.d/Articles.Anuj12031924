In the United States most colleges require at least two years of learning foreign language in high school for acceptance. There have been many studies done about what processes aid the development and growth of learning a second language. One interesting concept that people have found is that video games can be used to improve people's ability to learn and retain new languages. And I am not talking about games specifically designed to teach languages, normal video games, especially those with a multiplayer component serve the role just fine. Specifically games that cause the player to immerse themselves in the virtual environment tend to cause the player to learn and associate certain vocabulary with the game through repetition. Even single player games can do this by simply changing the language setting you will be forced to absorb the language as you go through. As you find enjoyment in games people tend to associate learning new words with these positive feelings and experiences allowing them to have a better memory recall on these topics. Online multiplayer games also have an added bonus of allowing students to practice language skills with both fluent, native speakers, as well as providing a layer of anonymity. Studies show that students who suffer from language anxiety struggle with practicing languages in person due to fear of embarrassment. Ultimately, people are not going to learn an entirely new language by playing video games, but if you are learning a new language they can be an incredible tool to enhance your growth.%0a%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.icls.edu/video-games-help-people-to-learn-a-new-language/%0ahttps://news.cci.fsu.edu/cci-news/cci-faculty/researchers-explore-second-language-acquisition-through-video-games/%0ahttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474706%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-095737-521230#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Made-up languages %0a-> - haridesikan%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 01:57-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-095737-521230 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aWhile the article focuses on using an artificial learning tool to learn a language, I'd like to consider using formal learning tools to learn an artificial language.

One of my family friends growing up played Minecraft in English despite not being a native speaker, so he could learn the language better. There are plenty of resources with the specific goal of language learning (for example https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/blog/english-adventures-with-cambridge-language-learning-with-minecraft), but beyond that even just playing the game in a language you will gradually start to pick things up. Minecraft has over 100 language options, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, Toki Pona, and even Klingon. There is even an option for Anglish, which is Modern English but without any Germanic loanwords.
