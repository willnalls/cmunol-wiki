This can be done with the "fry" or "false chord" mechanisms. If done properly, these are perfectly safe and do not harm the throat. These can be described anatomically, but are not closely related to linguistics.%0a%0aThe real use of the linguistic approach to phonetics is in building a specific tone from a low scream or high scream basis. Simply using the distortion mechanism with normal speech doesn't make very "brutal" vocals. However, manipulating the vowels in certain ways makes a much richer variety of scream sounds, including impossibly low lows and disgustingly dirty highs.%0a%0aThe "guttural" scream is one way to create very low growls. It doesn't involve changing any part of the distortion mechanism. The approach to the guttural is quite simple: starting with a normal low scream, make the vowels more back and more close, usually close to [ɯ]. Funnily enough, this could actually be described by the linguistic term "guttural". The reason it sounds so low is because of the nature of vowel overtones: often you can hear a mid-range tone floating over the distortion to give the scream a hollow sound.%0a%0aThe "tunnel throat" technique is a way to make high screams dirty and muddled. Similarly to the guttural, there is no change to the distortion mechanism. Starting with a high scream, make the vowels more front and more close, around [i] or [ɨ]. Usually, the tongue is also much farther forward than for a typical vowel, so it could be described as a syllabic alveolar approximant. Again, the nature of the sound comes from the vowel overtones, which clash with the distorted voice to make the specific tone.%0a%0aThis information is consciously used by death metal vocalists. The Youtube channel Kardavox Academy does videos analyzing death metal vocals, and the phonetic nature of vowels has been mentioned there several times.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210206-204000-741650#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-06.02.2021 - 12:40-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210206-204000-741650 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!jjmonroe%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Really interesting content, cool source'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aThis is really interesting, I've been listening to death metal for years but had never really considered the intricacy of the vocal techniques involved.
