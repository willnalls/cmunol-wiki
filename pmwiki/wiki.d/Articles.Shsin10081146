Traditionally, DeafBlind people in the US have communicated using variations of American Sign Language. However, ASL is a visual language and information can be lost when it is received tactually. Additionally, conventional ASL precludes direct communication between DeafBlind individuals and necessitates the use of interpreters even in conversations between DeafBlind people. Protactile arose out of a need and desire for DeafBlind people to communicate in ways that are not possible with visual ASL (1). %0a%0aProtactile has adapted the visual elements of ASL to make them accessible to DeafBlind people. Where ASL and other visual languages use the space around a signer's body to communicate (and an individual with visual impairments may not be able to differentiate between a sign made near the eyes compared to one made near the mouth), Protactile uses the space on the receiver's body instead (relying on the receiver's unimpaired sense of proprioception). This space is called contact space, and it is one of the features of Protactile that has led some linguists to call it an emerging language instead of merely a variation of ASL. The constraints of Protactile are different from ASL, demonstrating that it has unique rules and patterns, not just a modified lexicon (2). However, not all linguists believe that Protactile should be considered its own language. Some believe that there are elements of ASL missing from Protactile, while others consider it to be more like a dialect of ASL than a fully separate language (3). %0a%0aAn interesting feature of Protactile is seen in something called backchanneling. Backchanneling gives feedback to a person as they're speaking. In a conversation between hearing individuals, backchanneling might include someone saying "uh-huh" to indicate that they're paying attention or laughing to let others know that they understood a joke. In a conversation between sighted individuals, backchanneling could involve a person nodding to show agreement or raising their eyebrows to communicate surprise. Because DeafBlind people don't have full access to visual or auditory forms of backchanneling, Protactile replaces them with tactile cues such as tapping a person's arm to confirm understanding (4). %0a%0aCurrently, most Protactile users are adults and very few DeafBlind children have access to Protactile. Earlier this fall, a team of researchers led by Dr. Deanna Gagne of Gallaudet University was awarded a five-year grant of $2.5 million from the National Institutes of Health for this very purpose. This project will support the acquisition of Protactile in children ages 0-5 years old, with the goal of learning how DeafBlind children can learn Protactile (5). %0a%0a(1) https://www.opb.org/article/2022/01/05/new-language-for-deaf-blind-born-in-northwest/%0a(2) https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.579992/full%0a(3) https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/deafblind-communities-may-be-creating-a-new-language-of-touch%0a(4) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protactile%0a(5) https://gallaudet.edu/linguistics/protactile-language-acquisition-research-supported-by-2-5-million-nih-grant/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221026-034958-18110#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Protactile ++ %0a-> - justinzo%0a-> [-25.10.2022 - 20:49-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221026-034958-18110 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aProtactile as a way of communication is very receptive and spontaneous. The main language that is competing against Protactile American Sign Language was the original tactile ASL. The concept of back channeling as touched upon in the article is a big reason to use Protactile ASL over tactile ASL. In tactile ASL, people would often forget what the other person was saying because they had to wait for them to finish, remember everything they said and remember their own response as well.(1) This is complicated and causes the the communication between two people to be much less fluent. Back channeling allows for deafblind people to pick up on the subtle cues that we take for granted and allow them to respond in a proper way. Something else to note is that Protactile ASL involves a lot more touching than tactile ASL which is good as it allows for people to feel more connected together but it can also alienate people who are not comfortable with this approach. Overall, Protactile is a great resource to help the deafblind community and allow them to feel more connected with each other.%0a%0a%0a%0aSource: https://www.perkins.org/qa-how-pro-tactile-american-sign-language-ptasl-is-changing-the-conversation/%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221026-034958-18110#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: SignLanguage:)%0a(:Title: Protactile:)
