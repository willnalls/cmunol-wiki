In the video, the words hello /həloʊ/ and please /pliz/ are being satirically pronounced with a mock "Chinese accent" as /həɹoʊ/ and /pɹiz/ where the /l/ consonant is being substituted by the /ɹ/ consonant. %0a%0aThis is a very common stereotype associated with Chinese speakers of English in America but interestingly enough, it seems to have no factual origin. In both standard Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese, the /l/ phoneme exists in the onset of syllables[1, 2]. Thus, there is no reason to suspect native Chinese speakers to have problems with pronouncing the /l/ sound in the onset position such as in the words "hello" and "please". In my personal experience interacting with native Chinese speakers speaking English, I have never heard anyone substitute /l/ with /ɹ/ in a syllable onset. When I asked my parents, who are native Chinese speakers, they also agreed that they didn't think Chinese speakers speaking English would have problem pronouncing the /l/ sound in the onset.%0a%0aI suspect the origin of this incorrect stereotype has to do with mixing up the English dialects of native Chinese speakers with that of Japanese speakers. In Japanese, /l/ and /ɹ/ are not phonemes and the phoneme that most closely resembles those sounds is the alveolar flap /ɾ/[3]. Thus it is reasonable to think that Japanese speakers could have problems pronouncing /l/ in English, and substitute it with /ɹ/ which could be perceived as /ɹ/ by native English speakers (Another possibility being just mixing up the /l/ and /ɹ/ sounds as they are allophones in Japanese). Over time perhaps, the stereotype of Japanese English speakers expanded to include the English dialects of other East Asian countries. %0a%0aThe misattribution of the /l/ and /ɹ/ stereotype to Chinese speakers is indicative of a problematic pattern of discrimination in America: that of lumping together the wide and diverse cultures in Asia into one homogenous category. The ignorant reduction of separate cultures into a single, giant blob simply considered as "outsider" is extremely damaging to the personal identities of many Asian minorities in America.   %0a%0a[1] https://www.mustgo.com/worldlanguages/mandarin/%0a%0a[2] https://corpus.eduhk.hk/mandarin_pronunciation/?page_id=36%0a%0a[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210506-040314-457180#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!/l/ and /ɹ/ in Korean %0a-> - shreya_r%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAnother language where this stereotype could come from is Korean.
