While originally widely spoken throughout Southwestern England, successive invasions by non-Celtic groups into Britain over the centuries resulted in the Cornish language being pushed further west and into diminished use. This process accelerated after the establishment of England as a nation, in particular with the 1549 Prayerbook Rebellion in which Cornish Catholics revolted against the Anglican English, resulting in significant loss of life and further disuse of the Cornish language. By the turn of the 19th century, Cornish as a language had gone extinct with no remaining speakers. [3]%0aThroughout the past century, however, Cornish has gone under multiple efforts to be restored as a language in use. Starting in the 1920s, there have been efforts to both establish official spelling for Cornish (which in its original form had variable spelling) and promote its use in public. Recent developments, such as the use of Cornish in select pre-schools and the establishment of bodies such as the Cornish Language Partnership to promote its use, have allowed Cornish to enjoy use as a second language by a minority of Cornwall, with even a non-zero native speaker base. This revitalization has resulted in privileges for the language such as establishment as a protected minority language in the United Kingdom, furthering efforts.
