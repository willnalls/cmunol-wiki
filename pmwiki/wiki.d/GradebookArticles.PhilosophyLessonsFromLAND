The group would need to hike inLAND to set up camp, but Anne needed to first get a lay of the LAND before proceeding. They were in the hinterLANDs of MaryLAND, on a remote isLAND just recently inhabited. The inhabitants would be waiting for her group, like a child waiting on the LANDing of the steps for her parents to return home from work. They had already begun working the LAND, growing staple foods for the village. Anne knew that she had to give her crew a talk to boost morale, as the voyage had been taxing, but she was concerned that her words would not LAND. Her expert knowledge of the sea had LANDed her this position as captain, not her abilities for public speaking. Once the ship LANDed, Anne disembarked and scooped up some LAND in her hands, and watched a bird LAND just feet from her. She was excited to finally see LAND creatures after so much time at sea, and even more excited to permanently inhabit this great LAND. %0a%0aFrom this text taken from the Nacirema language, we can see the diverse applications of the word “land”. Fascinately, these people seem to have deep connections between earth, nature, nationality, employment, wildlife, terrain, the household, and personal identity. The interconnection between these complex ideas shows that these people see humans and earth as deeply intertwined. They value land so much that they even have a surname for it, and the people with this last name are often placed in positions of power as shown by Anne Land being the captain of this ship. They see land as a guiding force, a safe haven, a source of life, and I believe that we American people can learn from this. We must value our land just as the Nacirema people do, and we must see the ubiquity of earth in our lives and respect our planet as much as the Nacirema. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
