This claim that the student spoke the word iron wrong is a clear example of prescriptivism, stating that one way of saying a word is inherently incorrect and says something about the person's intelligence. %0a%0aThe student here pronounced iron as ['aɪɝn], a slight differentiation from the standard American version pronounced with an [ɝ] instead of an [ɚ], so a slight differentiation in height of the vowel. Overall though, we could consider this a way that someone with a Standardized American accent could pronounce 'iron'. (Please note, these are rhotic vowels with a special symbol added to them to convey they carry hints of an r sound).%0a%0aTypically, in UK countries, there is a distinct lack of a rhotic vowel, or r-colored vowel, as used in the student's pronunciation and used in the standard American English dialect. So, while the comment is unclear as to what aspect of the pronunciation was 'incorrect', I think the addition of [ɝ] is what made the commenter deem it as 'wrong' and unintellectual. %0a%0aThis video really just overall shows how language is flexible, especially with the comments contributing to the discussion, basically showing how many different ways people pronounce 'iron'. This flexibility is not something to discriminate by, but to embrace and accept. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
