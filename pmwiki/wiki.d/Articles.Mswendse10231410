In the video, the woman chides and laughs at her husband for pronouncing words in the sentence “The dog licked the oil and everyone laughed” in a way that she believes is “wrong”. Her husband has a Southern American English accent, but she believes that pronouncing the sentence in the Standardized American English accent is the “correct” pronunciation. %0a%0aHer main criticism, which comes up multiple times in the video, lies in the way her husband pronounces “oil”. In Standardized American English, “oil” is pronounced as [ɔɪl], but her husband pronounces it as [ol]. The pronunciation, [ɔɪl], includes a mid-back-rounded-lax vowel [ɔ], a high-front-unrounded-lax vowel [ɪ], and a voiced approximant (lateral) alveolar consonant. However, the way the husband pronounces it [ol], with a mid-back-rounded-tense vowel [o] replacing the [ɔɪ] (1). The vowel [ɔ] is more often applied to Northern American English dialects rather than Southern (2). Additionally, the only difference between [ɔ] and [o] is the tenseness, and the tenseness of [o] that is present in the Southern American English pronunciation of “oil” means that position of the tongue and lips is more extreme and requires greater muscle usage. Because of this, the [ɪ] appears deleted from this pronunciation as well. The wife in the video does not appear to have a Southern American English accent herself, so to her she is criticizing the deletion of the lax vowel that bridges the initial vowel and ending consonant together in the Standardized American English pronunciation of “oil”.%0a%0aThis criticized pronunciation variant of “oil” belongs to the Southern American English dialect, as established in the video and by the video’s title. The Southern American English dialect pronounces it similar to the word “ol”, a shortened version of “old”.%0a%0a(1) https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2014/ling115/phonetics.html%0a%0a(2) https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/553139/allbrittenrachael.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221103-182934-316420#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Addition to Southern Accents and SAE %0a-> - hyunsunb%0a-> [-03.11.2022 - 11:29-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221103-182934-316420 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aFrom the perspective of the speaker, it doesn't always seem as though you have an accent, when in reality everyone has an accent.

For background, I grew up in Arlington, Texas, a city right between Dallas and Fort Worth. The whole metroplex (which is a word that was invented entirely to describe the Dallas-Fort Worth cities and neighboring areas) is referred to as DFW.%0a%0aDFW is a particularly interesting area of Texas culturally. In the WIRED article on accents from PSET2, it was noted in a lot of urban areas a "General American" accent has developed, which is characterized by a particular lack of standard features. Austin was noted as a city with this phenomena, but DFW definitely has it too, albeit to a smaller extent. DFW is urban but to a lesser extent, exists more as a collection of suburbs going on seemingly endlessly. The biggest proof of this I can give is that Tarrant county, where Arlington is, was the largest population county to vote Trump in 2020, though the vote was nearly split 50-50 (for those who may not be familiar with US politics, the Republican party that Trump ran under is more often supported by rural Americans while urban Americans tend to vote Democrat).%0a%0aGrowing up, I have never been told I have an accent, but I definitely met classmates and such that obviously did have more of the characteristics of Southern American English despite living no more than 30 minutes apart. A good anecdote that my father told me once is that he was speaking to a woman who had a very obvious Southern twang, which I lack the techniques to fully describe but is an accent with higher nasality and some vowel shifts that I can recognize but can't tell you what they are. They discovered they grew up but 10 minutes away from each other, in Fort Worth. The woman then disclaimed to my father something along the lines of "how come we grew up right next to each other, yet you sound like that and I sound like this?" referring to her voice, which was a really interesting question. Their place of origin was geographically about as similar as you can get, yet my father has what is probably considered a "General American" accent and his friend has an accent that would probably get made criticized by some as not conforming to the "Standard" way of pronouncing things. While this is anecdotal, I think it says a lot about the general experience of the DFW area and how you get this interesting mishmash of Southern American English and General American, which from an outsider may look like completely different walks of life, yet we all grew up in the same town.%0a%0aThis is really just one little story from one little place, but I think it stands to show that the diversity of language is such that criticism's like this that try to "correct" pronunciation are impractical to even attempt.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221111-004103-578890#%0a#foxbegin 221113-212646-96160#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Prejudices and how it affects the portrayal of SAE %0a-> - iamiller%0a-> [-13.11.2022 - 13:26-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221113-212646-96160 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI hate to admit it, but I think that even I have some prejudices against the southern accent.
