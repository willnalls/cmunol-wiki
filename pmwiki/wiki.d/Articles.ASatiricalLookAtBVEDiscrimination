He mentions that "people say I talk with a white voice anyway", to which his colleague responds that he still doesn't talk "white enough", comparing Cash's speaking to "Will Smith white". His colleague then shows Cash how to speak in a "white voice", what might be considered Standard American English. In being dubbed by an actual white actor, this scene highlights the unrealistic expectation for BVE speakers to speak in Standard American English in order to succeed and be accepted professionally.%0a%0aI chose this example because dark comedy and satire is a great way to shine a light on issues that may be too ingrained or mundane for people not affected. By exaggerating "white voice" in contrast to BVE, ''Sorry to Bother You'' encourages more vivid conversation about BVE discrimination.
