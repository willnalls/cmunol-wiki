Also, I know Raritan (near where I live) has a name originating from an indigenous language, and I know of some nearby events that are organized by indigenous people (the Redhawk Indigenous Arts Counsel). %0a	The tribe in this area is the Munsee-Delaware Nation, a sub-tribe of the Lenape. The IPA transcription of the english version of Lenape is [‘lɛnəpi], where for a Lenape pronounciation, the transcription is [ləˈnɑːpe]. In Lenape, the name for the Munsee-Delaware subtribe is “Nalahii Lunaapewaak”, meaning “Lenape from upstream” (I could not find an IPA transcription of this name, or audio of it being spoken to transcribe myself).  The term Delaware used to refer to this tribe is not indigenous in origin, being a name that English colonists came up with from the name of the first governor of Virginia, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, with his title being derived from French. From what I can tell, either name is acceptable, but Munsee-Delaware/Nalahii Lunaapewaak is more specific than just Lenape.%0a	There are several treaties between the Munsee Lenape and the US government, including the treaty of Greenville, which redefined the boundary between American and Native territory in excahnge for a cessation of fighting (and which was quickly nullified by the Americans). The final treaty between the US government and the Delaware people was the 1886 Treaty with the Delaware, in which the Delaware council agreed to give up their reservation in Kansas and move to an area of their choice on the lands given up to the Federal government by one of several tribes: the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, or Seminole.%0a	The Munsee Lenape language is classified as critically endangered by the UNESCO atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger. According to various sources, there are fewer than 10 native speakers of Munsee, all of whom are elderly.%0a	There are efforts to preserve the Lenape languages, which are Munsee and Unami. These seem to refer more broadly to the Lenape language, than to Munsee specifically. One specific resource that was developed is the Lenape Talking Dictionary, which has recordings of many stories and phrases along with grammar and vocabulary lessons. From what I can find, the only place that the Munsee language is spoken day-to-day only in a few Indigenous communities in Ontario, but there are efforts to teach the language in schools and at community events.%0a	The non-indigenous sources tended to focus on the history and the literal phonological content of the language, where indigenous sources tended to focus on the current use and interest in learning the language, along with where efforts are being made to document and teach the language. I think indigenous sources gave a much better sense of Munsee as a living, if endangered, language, and they were much more up to date about the recent history of the language.%0a%0aReferences: %0ahttps://delawaretribe.org/blog/2013/06/26/language/%0ahttps://delawaretribe.org/services-and-programs/historic-preservation/removal-history-of-the-delaware-tribe/%0ahttps://delawaretribe.org/services-and-programs/language-revitalization/%0ahttps://www.talk-lenape.org/getting-started%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsee_language%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)%0a(:Title: Munsee Lenape:)
