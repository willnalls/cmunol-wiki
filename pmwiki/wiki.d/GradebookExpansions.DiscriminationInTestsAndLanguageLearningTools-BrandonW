One result that has occurred is that minorities are overrepresented in special education programs. A reason that inaccurate assessments occur is that an examiner may not be fully familiar with a person's cultural/linguistic background. An example is that in African American English, the sentence "he walks to school" is actually said as "he walk to school" as the third person "-s" is deleted. An examiner may believe that this is evidence of language disorder when in reality it is a part of the person's dialect. Another reason is that tests are written in Standard American English instead of in a speaker's linguistic background, so scores on the test maybe lower than what they should be.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
