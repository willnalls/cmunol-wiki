Firstly, I finally want to learn what the deal is with transcription. I have seen it before but I have never understood how to take a word and transcribe it. I ponder frequently about how many languages there are too. I find it fascinating that there are not more dead languages. Even more interesting is that a common language has not seemingly emerged yet. I do not think one will, but I wonder what it would be like if a common, worldwide language formed. I have other thoughts, ranging from the brain and language to history, but those are the big two ideas I wonder about.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----
