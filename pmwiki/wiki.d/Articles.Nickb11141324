With only 400 speakers it is considered endangered, the vast majority of speakers live in Istria, although there are immigrant communities in Sardinia which continue to speak the language. The Istrian peninsula has historically been a place of much contention, with Austria-Hungary, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Croatia all having made claims to the land over the past hundred years. This diversity has lead to the decline in speakers, as it was easier to simply use the language of the country that currently had control of the area. Although it is a Romance language its heritage is difficult to follow, with some linguists claiming a relationship with Venetian, and others instead pointing to Rhaetian or Gallic languages as sisters languages. Although its community of speakers is limited there is a strong cultural connection with the language, and its use is steady in certain villages along the coast. In conclusion Istriot is an endangered language which is has been declining in use due to several factors.%0a%0aSources: https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ist%0ahttps://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/istr1244%0ahttps://www.iemed.org/publication/istrian-spring/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221122-005504-65840#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Pronunciation Video for the Istriot Language %0a-> - elliefu%0a-> [-21.11.2022 - 16:55-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221122-005504-65840 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aBelow is a YouTube link for a video with pronunciations for key vocabulary and greetings for the Istriot language.
