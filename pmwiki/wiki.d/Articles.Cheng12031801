Deaf jokes basically come in two main forms: language-based play and deaf experience(1).%0a%0aLanguage-based play usually has something to do with the dual meaning of body language. A great example is the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Up-ws1BlBtA. The teacher asked the boy "One chicken plus one chicken equals how many?" and he wrote down "duck". (Because for "chicken" you sign the "beak" sign with your pointer finger and thumb pressed together, while for "duck" you press both your pointer and middle finger together with your thumb.) The pun is another common form of language-based play. It's a play that uses homonyms or double meanings of a sign(1). Understanding language-based jokes usually requires fluency in that specific sign language, but some also make sense in spoken English. A famous example is "pasteurized milk" in ASL. The sign for "milk" in most ASL dialects is squeezing one hand as if milking a cow, and then "pasteurized milk" is making the sign for "milk" while moving your hands "past-your-eyes", as shown in the Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGprfOaUxsA.%0a%0aWhen it comes to deaf experience, one popular joke is "the Hotel" as depicted on https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=322: A married deaf couple stayed at a hotel for a night. The deaf husband went out for a drink but the deaf wife preferred to sleep. The husband had too many beers to remember his room number. He saw that all the hotel windows were dark and everyone was sleeping, so he went to his car and honked hard in front of the hotel. One after another lights through the windows were turned on. All but one that remained dark and that's his room! However, some of these jokes are self-mockery and can be inappropriate to share among the hearing community jokingly.%0a%0aTo appreciate the humor in sign languages is to appreciate the creativity, culture, history, and heritage of sign languages. We should break our stereotype of sign languages and learn to avoid microaggressions toward the signing community.%0a%0a(1) https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=355%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221208-194043-914540#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!more on sign language  %0a-> - tingchen%0a-> [-08.12.2022 - 11:40-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221208-194043-914540 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aSign language, although sometimes not taken as a language (as it is not verbal), is in fact a language!
