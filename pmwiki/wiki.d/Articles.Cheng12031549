Color exposure determines color naming; color naming affects color perception.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aColor is a visual perceptual property, and we have far fewer names for colors than colors we can distinguish between. Color terminologies vary cross-linguistically and interact with speakers' color cognition.%0a%0aOn one hand, the use of color terms might depend on communicative needs. According to the article "Color naming across languages reflects color use"(1), objects (what we talk about) are typically warm-colored, and warm colors are communicated more efficiently than cool colors cross-linguistically. Communicative needs also explain why the number of color terms varies across languages: Cultures vary in how useful color is. Industrialization, which creates objects distinguishable solely based on color, increases color usefulness. In other words, you name what you see.%0a%0aOn the other hand, the names we give to colors affect our perception of them. According to the article "The way you see colour depends on what language you speak"(2), Greek speakers have two separate color terms to describe light and dark blue – "ghalazio" and "ble", while English speakers describe both colors as "blue". After living for long periods of time in the UK, Greek speakers start to see these two colors as more similar. In other words, you see what you name.%0a%0aLinguistic relativity and the color naming debate is an interesting interdisciplinary topic involving cognitive linguistics. It still welcomes new perspectives and inspires many other research topics.%0a%0aNow I want to deviate a little and write about my confusion during my search online: In Berlin and Kay's famous study of colors, they identified 11 basic color terms in English: black, white, gray, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, orange, purple, and brown. However, there wasn’t an English word for the color “orange” until 200 years after the citrus fruit of the same name arrived in Europe. Before then, the color was called by the two other colors that, when mixed, make orange: “yellow-red.”(3) In comparison, oranges (guess why it's called mandarin) have been cultivated by Chinese people for thousands of years, but orange as a color term doesn't even make it into the 8 or 9 basic color categories according to some researchers. For instance, on WALS's map Number of Basic Colour Categories(4), I see that Chinese has 8 basic color categories instead of 11 in other popular languages. As a native Chinese speaker, I feel that the basic colors in Chinese correspond exactly to those 11 in English. From my observation, the older generation tends to describe an orange object as "orange-yellow" and pink as "pink-red", thus violating the monolexemic criteria(5), while the younger generation tends to treat "orange" or "pink" as basic colors. Maybe Mandarin Chinese keeps forming compound words or loan words and gradually "absorbs" them into a single morpheme as people love to abbreviate things. But why is Mandarin categorized as isolating in the first place? From my perspective, ancient Chinese is isolating but modern simplified Chinese is quite agglutinative.%0a%0a(1) https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1619666114%0a(2) https://theconversation.com/the-way-you-see-colour-depends-on-what-language-you-speak-94833%0a(3) https://qz.com/1454466/your-language-influences-your-color-perception-says-a-new-study%0a(4) https://wals.info/feature/133A%0a(5) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate#Berlin_and_Kay%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221205-215502-621830#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Extreme Example of Varying Color Perception through the Himba Tribe %0a-> - joe201%0a-> [-05.12.2022 - 13:55-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221205-215502-621830 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThis idea that color naming affects color perception is really interesting! Something interesting I learned about it however is that the differences in color perception between speakers of different languages can be much more extreme than as shown in the Greek example of light and dark blue.%0aThe Himba tribe, native to Northern Namibia, are a good example of how extreme this variation can be. The Himba, as a semi-nomadic group with minimal contact with the outside world until recently, developed a language with words for colors that are very different than those seen in the West or other large areas. In particular, the Himba only have 5 colors categories as opposed to the 11 seen in the West. However, our notion of “green” is split up among 3 distinct categories by the Himba language. [1] Because of this difference, research conducted a test on monolingual Himba speakers and Westerners, where they showed both groups images containing a wheel of colored squares, where one color was different than the others in the wheel, with the rest colored a shade of green. Both groups were tasked with finding the odd color out (The wheels are linked below if you want to try!). [2] Crucially, one wheel has an altered color that has a different word in the Himba language but not in English, while the other has an altered color with a different word in English but not in the Himba language. The researchers found, like you mentioned above, that each group could consistently spot the odd color they had a different word for, but struggled in finding the color that used the same word. [3] %0aWhat makes this particular experiment so interesting to me is how even after reading about it, I still have trouble distinguishing between the colors despite knowing the answer. The idea that someone else could simultaneously distinguish between these colors and not be able to distinguish between colors I can easily differentiate really proves that a person’s language does affect their color perception, at least to me. One final interesting note about the colors: the RGB color values of the colors the Himba could distinguish really are significantly closer than those that the Westerners could distinguish, which opens a whole discussion about the eurocentrism of digital technology that I am not nearly qualified enough to talk about.

Color exposure determines color naming; color naming affects color perception.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#summaryends]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c [[#content]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Color is a visual perceptual property, and we have far fewer names for colors than colors we can distinguish between. Color terminologies vary cross-linguistically and interact with speakers' color cognition.%0a%3c %0a%3c On one hand, the use of color terms might depend on communicative needs. According to the article "Color naming across languages reflects color use"(1), objects (what we talk about) are typically warm-colored, and warm colors are communicated more efficiently than cool colors cross-linguistically. Communicative needs also explain why the number of color terms varies across languages: Cultures vary in how useful color is. Industrialization, which creates objects distinguishable solely based on color, increases color usefulness. In other words, you name what you see.%0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, the names we give to colors affect our perception of them. According to the article "The way you see colour depends on what language you speak"(2), Greek speakers have two separate color terms to describe light and dark blue – "ghalazio" and "ble", while English speakers describe both colors as "blue". After living for long periods of time in the UK, Greek speakers start to see these two colors as more similar. In other words, you see what you name.%0a%3c %0a%3c Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate is an interesting interdisciplinary topic involving cognitive linguistics. It still welcomes new perspectives and inspires many other research topics.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now I want to deviate a little and write about my confusion during my search online: In Berlin and Kay's famous study of colors, they identified 11 basic color terms in English: black, white, gray, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, orange, purple, and brown. However, there wasn’t an English word for the color “orange” until 200 years after the citrus fruit of the same name arrived in Europe. Before then, the color was called by the two other colors that, when mixed, make orange: “yellow-red.”(3) In comparison, oranges (guess why it's called mandarin) have been cultivated by Chinese people for thousands of years, but orange as a color term doesn't even make it into the 8 or 9 basic color categories according to some researchers. For instance, on WALS's map Number of Basic Colour Categories(4), I see that Chinese has 8 basic color categories instead of 11 in other popular languages. As a native Chinese speaker, I feel that the basic colors in Chinese correspond exactly to those 11 in English. From my observation, the older generation tends to describe an orange object as "orange-yellow" and pink as "pink-red", thus violating the monolexemic criteria(5), while the younger generation tends to treat "orange" or "pink" as basic colors. Maybe Mandarin Chinese keeps forming compound words or loan words and gradually "absorbs" them into a single morpheme as people love to abbreviate things. But why is Mandarin categorized as isolating in the first place? From my perspective, ancient Chinese is isolating but modern simplified Chinese is quite agglutinative.%0a%3c %0a%3c (1) https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1619666114%0a%3c (2) https://theconversation.com/the-way-you-see-colour-depends-on-what-language-you-speak-94833%0a%3c (3) https://qz.com/1454466/your-language-influences-your-color-perception-says-a-new-study%0a%3c (4) https://wals.info/feature/133A%0a%3c (5) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate#Berlin_and_Kay%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#contentends]]%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expansions:%0a%3c [[#expansions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#expansionsend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c You must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%3c %0a%3c (:else:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Comments%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a%3c !!Change article category%0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:Section: A:)%0a%3c (:Category: Varia:)%0a%3c (:Title: Naming of Colors:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
