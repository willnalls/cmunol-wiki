It is often used when someone still follows out-of-date trends about fashion, habits on social media, or usage of slang (2). Cheugy can also be used to refer to something mainstream or basic.

Cheugy has a clear meaning used as a pejorative description of lifestyle trends. Widespread and sustained use are elements that would be difficult to advocate for adding cheugy to the OED. The word originated in 2013 but was not popularized until it was mentioned in a TikTok video in 2021 which received around 100,00 likes (1). Its popularity also seems to be contained within a certain subset of social media and Gen Z, but it has not quite reached mainstream usage.%0a%0aThere has also been some conflict surrounding cheugy. Some have suggested that the word has misogynistic connotations due to its targeting of trends associated with millennial women like “girl bosses” or specific styles of jeans.
