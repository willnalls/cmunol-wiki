Examining this further, we can gain insight on the culture of the Nacirema.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aLet’s examine the word BANK. We can walk to the river’s BANK, or sled across the BANKS of snow. We select questions from a question BANK, or supplies from a BANK of equipment, or even play a game of pool, trying to make as many BANK shots as we can. I think we can BANK on who’ll win, and then the winner can BANK a huge monetary prize for their win, depositing or BANKING their cash into the BANK. In other words, the winner can make BANK. And of course, this would be with the help of the banker, a BANK. But BANK takes it even further, producing two meanings within the same exact phrase. If the prize is big enough, the winner may break the BANK; if the prize is too small, the winner may still break the BANK trying to make large purchases. BANK goes on to take meaning in more obscure contexts. A ship’s BANK may hold a large quantity of oars; a plane may fly with BANK if changing directions. A blood BANK stores human blood, a memory BANK stores computer memory, and a paper BANK stores paper to be recycled. You may decide to BANK other items for later. You may also decide to BANK with a certain institution over another depending on your comfort.%0a%0aFrom the wide use of this word as both a verb and an adjective, we can understand better the belief system of the Nacirema culture. The Nacirema seem to value the long-term preservation of materials, ranging from currency to memory and even bodily fluids such as blood and sperm. Their culture revolves around maintaining the past for unknown future purposes. Considering the many monetary concepts the word refers to, the Nacirema appear to be a capitalistic society, placing a lot of value on money. The use of the word “bank” also suggests the Nacirema often took part in gambling and other sorts of risk-taking, which can be illustrated in the phrase “banking on who will win.” The fact that the same word is strangely used to mean a financial institution, part of a river, and a collection of snow may imply that the Nacirema saw great value in nature just as they do the institution that they trust to safeguard their currency. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
