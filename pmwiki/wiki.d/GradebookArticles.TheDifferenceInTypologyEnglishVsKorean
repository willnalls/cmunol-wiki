Uncommon consonants refer to consonants that are hard to found in the majority of languages and can be classified into four types: clicks, labial-velar plosives, pharyngeals, and dental or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives. These uncommon consonants are usually found in clusters by being influenced by one another but also exist dispersed from each other.  %0a%0a  English and Korean both have the average size of the set of consonants used, with no glottalized consonants. However, like 79.2%25 of the existing language, there is no uncommon consonant present in the Korean language, with English having a "Th" sound. "Th" is a dental fricative that is pronounced with voiceless "θ" and voiced "ð". A Greek small letter theta,"θ", is mostly found in clusters in Europe and Africa. It is especially concentrated near south Sudan. But it is also scattered in locations such as South America, showing the possibility of the spontaneous advent of the consonant. The Latin small letter eth, "ð" is more in clusters in parts of Europe, Africa, and Australia but finds similar patterns as "θ" in geological distribution. %0a%0a  During the research, I realized east Asia, including parts of Russia, China, Japan, and so on, doesn't have the "th" sound. I wonder why this is considering that the location is surrounded by countries with languages that contain "th" signs. If not influenced by other languages, why were there no spontaneous advent of such consonants like other parts of the world?%0aFurthermore, it is hard for people to pronounce uncommon consonants if they are from locations with its absence. Korea, for instance, has no "th" sound. So most Koreans have difficulty pronouncing "th" when they first learn English, especially those who are older. Considering that place, manner, and voicing are the factors in how you make a consonant sound, I wonder if a perfect native sound of such uncommon consonants would be possible for everyone if they keep on practicing. %0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://wals.info/feature/19A#2/19.3/152.9%0ahttps://wals.info/chapter/19%0ahttps://phoible.org/parameters/7D184A6DCDA3EB154F9CB34651E02EEE#3/-18.15/280.37%0ahttps://phoible.org/parameters/C74BECEC6C9DBC95D2C92E893F72A8A%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
