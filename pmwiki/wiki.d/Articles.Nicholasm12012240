Despite the regional limitation and being understood by only 0.5%25 of the population, Romansh is one of the four official languages of Switzerland. It originally developed as a blend of vulgar (spoken) Latin and the indigenous Rhaetian languages.%0a%0aEthnologue characterizes Romansh as "Institutional," or 0–4, on its EGIDS scale, indicating little concern for the language. UNESCO, on the other hand, classified Romansh as "Definitely Endangered" in 2010, indicating that the majority of speakers were of parental generations and that there was little use of Romansh as a first language.%0a%0aRomansh is sort of an umbrella term for the five idioms that exist today—Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter and Vallader—which are different from the regional dialects as they diverge both in spoken and written forms. According to Lia Rumantscha (LR), a Swiss academic institute devoted to promoting Romansh language and culture, one of the biggest difficulties for the future of the language is emigration of native Romansh speakers and lack of available Romansh education for children with another of the country's other official languages (German, French, and Italian) as their first language.%0a%0aToday, Romansh is supported by various government-supported and independent efforts in revitalization. Immigrants to the Graubünden canton can receive a language certificate in Romansh, and LR has developed a specific course for Portuguese immigrants after an influx in recent years. There is also a revitalization of Romansh in the arts; Liricas Analas is a hip hop group that performs exclusively in Romansh. In the 2023–24 school year, LR will be launching a program for Swiss high school students to learn Romansh as an option alongside the other national languages for the "third national language" requirement.%0a%0aExamples of spoken Romansh:%0a• https://youtu.be/LAnWWcSrTFU — Lone speaker%0a• https://youtu.be/n7fJBUH1JCE — Conversational (w/ translated subtitles)%0a%0aSources:%0a• https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180627-switzerlands-mysterious-fourth-language%0a• https://www.ethnologue.com/size-and-vitality/roh%0a• https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000187026%0a• https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/romansh_switzerland-s-smallest-national-language-struggles-for-survival/43242444%0a• http://www.liarumantscha.ch/?changeLang=_en%0a• https://migration.swiss/en/migration-report-2021/immigration-and-integration/romansh%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221210-020052-377270#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!History of Romansh %0a-> - josiahs%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 18:00-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-020052-377270 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThis youtube video details the history of Romansh and how it has come to be, complete with the state of Romansh currently and the arguments of how it will be used in the future %0a%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bTFiRHLflc%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221210-020052-377270#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Romansh:)
