For example, ‘memory’, ‘money’, and ‘food’ all seem to be in a “bank” of some sort. “Banks” act as storage for things that people need to use and necessities. They have to go to banks to get both material and nonmaterial items for daily use. The Nacirema prioritize collecting and putting things into “banks,” relying on these things for various tasks. This reliance is also heavily focused on in their society. They also like to use the word “bank” to talk about nature and dirt which seems completely different from the collection idea that “bank” also seems to be about. The Nacirema is a very divided society which is split between those who care about money and those who care about nature forms. %0a%0aSource: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bank%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210327-165218-847600#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Negative meaning of BANK %0a-> - BrandonN%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe meaning of BANK has changed overtime and today it can have different interpretations based upon classes of American people.

Also, there seems to be a high importance placed on games, such as H-O-R-S-E and billiards. These inferences lead me to believe that in the Nacirema society, individuals place themselves, and their own personal accumulation of wealth and objects, above that of their society.
