It is widely spoken in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau, being the dominant and co-official language of the last two (1). This language is endangered due to the pressure of mainland China's government and their economic expansion. Some people argue that Cantonese is not worth saving because it'd be better to share a common language with mainland China to boost trading resources and ideas (2). Cantonese is also arguably harder to learn than Mandarin, as there are more tones (6 compared to 4), and has less speakers (80 million compared to 920 million) (3 & 4). While Mandarin classes are offered at almost every American university, effort is being made to keep Cantonese in the few universities that offer it. This past January, Stanford University received a $1 million dollar gift to support their Cantonese program after the program had a huge budget cut just a year before (5). Efforts like this will help expand the number of Cantonese leaners and keep Cantonese from going extinct. %0a%0a1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese%0a2. https://www.kellyyang.edu.hk/is-cantonese-a-language-worth-preserving/#:~:text=Due%2520to%2520pressure%2520from%2520the,it%2520sustains%2520local%2520Cantonese%2520culture.%0a3. https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-difference-between-mandarin-and-cantonese-1535880%0a4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese%0a5. https://stanforddaily.com/2022/02/16/donors-gift-1-million-to-support-stanford-cantonese-program/%0a	%0a	%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221028-075435-54790#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Cantonese in Chinese Language Evolution %0a-> - maxwell%0a-> [-28.10.2022 - 00:54-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221028-075435-54790 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe evolution of Chinese language is broadly marked by a decline in the number of consonants that can begin and end words.
