Linguistically, BASL and ASL differ in phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. Often, signs in BASL are produced farther away from the body (this is known as having a larger signing space). Additionally, BASL signers tend to use two-handed sign variants whereas ASL signers typically use one-handed variants. Another major difference is that some signs in BASL are borrowed from BVE/AAVE. %0aThroughout history, members of the Black Deaf community were discriminated against for being both Black and deaf. They were not accepted by the Deaf community for being Black and they were not accepted by the African-American community because they were Deaf. Organizations that advocated for civil rights like the NAACP and the SCLC did not focus on the concerns of the Black Deaf community. Often, the Black Deaf community could not even access these civil rights organizations. Black Deaf people were also barred from joining organizations that advocated for the Deaf community such as the NaD (National Association of the Deaf). %0aUntil the 1970s, many states still maintained separate schools for Black and White Deaf students. The development of Black American Sign Language came as a result of this forced separation. %0aIn the 1980s, two conferences formed by local committees led to the establishment of an organization called the National Black Deaf Advocates. Today, the NBDA has over 30 local chapters and offers many programs such as “leadership training programs for high school and college students, a Miss Black Deaf America Pageant, leadership opportunities at the local and national levels, workshops at regional and national conferences, and a scholarship program for deserving Black Deaf college students” (DCMP).%0a%0aSources: %0a%0ahttps://dcmp.org/learn/366-black-deaf-culture-through-the-lens-of-black-deaf-history%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_American_Sign_Language%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210507-022907-614200#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Some more background on BASL %0a-> - solanaM%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aHere is an interesting article which gives some additional background information on Black American Sign Language: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/us/black-american-sign-language-tiktok.html%0a%0aApparently, thanks to online platforms like TikTok, BASL has been getting more attention recently. Although BASL has been historically overlooked by scholars and often assumed to be a lesser version of modern ASL, more recent scholarly research suggests the BASL is actually closer to early ASL, which was heavily influenced by French sign language, than contemporary ASL is. One explanation for this is that in the 1870s and 80s, deaf schools for white students pushed students to learn to speak and lip-read rather than focusing on signing, thus Black signers retained the standards of ASL that were lost to many white deaf communities. In fact, many white signing teachers ended up moving to Black deaf schools to teach signing because of this. The article also discusses how it is common for signers of BASL to switch between BASL and ASL depending on the context, similar to how speakers of BVE switch between BVE and Standard American English in different contexts.%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210507-022907-614200#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210430-185303-258030#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-30.04.2021 - 11:53-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210430-185303-258030 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!MindeeL%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aI feel like that is the experience of so many people who fall in two or more different minority groups.
