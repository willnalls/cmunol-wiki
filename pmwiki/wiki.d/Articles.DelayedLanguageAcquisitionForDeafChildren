In deaf children born to deaf parents who use a form of sign language, or to hearing parents who have learned a form of sign language and use that in front of the child, they also have early exposure to some form of language. However, to deaf children born to parents who have never learned a form of sign language and perhaps have been actively discouraged from learning one, their first form of linguistic exposure is often delayed until they attend some sort of school, perhaps a residential school for deaf children. %0a%0aInterestingly enough, studies about these language delayed deaf children have shown that some developed their own form of sign language commonly called a “home sign” system. However, studies have also shown that after learning a “conventional” sign language later on (usually at a school), these children show less proficiency compared to their counterparts who started at a younger age. Comprehension and production test for ASL was administered to different groups of ASL speakers who considered it their primary language: native, early, and late learners of ASL. Scores on production and comprehension tests especially for morphology indicated that the native learners had an advantage over early learners and same for native/early learners over late learners. %0aThus, it seems that deaf children born to families where they do not have early access to any language system puts them at a disadvantage later on in life at fluently acquiring a language. Awareness of this issue could perhaps help parents who have children in this situation find a solution to help them have exposure to language as early as possible in their life.%0a%0a%0aSources:%0a%0ahttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935345.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935345-e-19%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: F:)%0a(:Category: SignLanguage:)
