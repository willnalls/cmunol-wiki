Kane also seems to have his own distinctive speech patterns which make him particularly difficult to understand for an American English speaker such as myself. Kane tends to nasalize most of his sounds, and all of his consonants tend to be pushed further back so there is a much higher frequency of uvular and glottal sounds. For example, he tends to turn the unvoiced alveolar stop [t] into a glottal stop [ʔ] and similarly turning velar stops [k] and [g] into their uvular counterparts [q] and [ɢ] or a glottal stop [ʔ]. His voiced fricatives in particular sometimes sound different (to my ears) because they often turn into the uvular [ʁ]. %0a%0aAlthough his accent is quite different from what we're expected to hear, he should not be thought of as any less for it.
