The Little Mermaid TV show, released in 1993, acted as one of the first examples of a piece of animated media that featured a character using ASL correctly. The show featured a mermaid named Gabriella who was deaf. Gabriella was animated to be using ASL for all of her "lines". She was accompanied by an octopus named Ollie that translated the ASL for viewers who did not know it. In Gabriella's episode, Ariel sings a song about learning to dance and Gabriella signs a long (this can be seen in the linked YouTube video).%0a%0a%0a%0a1)https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriella%0a2)https://deafniche.com/remembering-little-mermaid-tv-series/%0a3)https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=108&v=VJLem7kzqCc&feature=emb_logo%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-200036-691620#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!ASL in Animation (expansion) %0a-> - adrian%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 12:00-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-200036-691620 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAlthough ASL is still not very common, there have been a few more recent examples of sign language being used in animations.
