More specifically, the machine can analyze the pattern of a waveform by tracking data in between the crests of a wave to show if someone is saying something that is voiced or devoiced. A machine can also track the beginning of a word through a spectrogram that demonstrates whether a word started with a voiced or voiceless plosive. In addition, the development of deep learning algorithms can generate a further understanding of patterns and aspects of sound through a spectrogram to fully map out a language without feeding the idea of words and text to a machine. Machines can also utilize more simple algorithms that utilize trees to break down NLP in the form of text to test out if certain sentences in many different languages are grammatical or not, and it can train itself to rule in "rule-breaker" rules that do not follow the set "rules" of a language. I quote the word "rules" because machines can figure out before someone specific generalizations of a language or dialect of a language that people see as grammatical but have yet to create a more concise, overarching understanding of outliers that they see. Specifically, the rule of the head-compliant rule in English could potentially be combined with the adjunction rule by a machine, which is something that is not seen to be seen as the same among people. Maybe one day, machines can break down the morphology and allomorphy of areas that are not too focused on within the field of linguistics, with possible concentration of animal "language".%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: :)%0a(:Category: Varia:)%0a(:Title: NLP:)
