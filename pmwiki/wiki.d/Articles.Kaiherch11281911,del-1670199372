When researching neurolinguistics, I came across an article that details the brain matter of bilingual children. According to a new study by an international team of academics, bilingual participants had more grey and white matter than same-aged children who only spoke one language. In the past, bilingualism has positively affected brain structure and cognitive performance in adults, but the new study shows another language can have the same impact on developing brains in children. This is the first time there has been strong evidence for a positive effect on grey and white matter, as it has been studied in adults before. Grey matter is lost over time, but the loss was less pronounced in bilinguals. This impact can benefit language function, such as performance in attention and executive control. This was extremely interesting to me as my sisters and I were taught Tagalog at a young age, which would be different from learning the language in high school. There are countless benefits to learning another language at a young age, and this is already done in countries like China. It brings the question on whether or not the same tactic should be used in the United States. %0a%0ahttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200902095125.htm%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)%0a(:Title: Brain Matter in Bilinguals:)
