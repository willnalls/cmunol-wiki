English does not have front rounded vowels while Mandarin has one, denoted as [y] in the IPA chart but denoted as ü in Pinyin (the Romanized spelling system for Chinese characters). The closest vowel to ü in English is ‘i’; ü can be pronounced by saying “iii” and then rounding the lips. Most characters with the ü vowel are spelled using ‘u’ as there is not that much overlap in consonants that pair with ‘u’ vs ü. Some examples of this are: 鱼 (yú – fish), 玉 (yù – jade), 去 (qù – go), 举 (jǔ – lift), 需要 (xūyào – need). The only exceptions to this are characters that contain ‘nü’ or ‘lü,’ as ‘nu’ and ‘lu’ also exist. Some examples of this are: 女人 (nǚrén – woman), 绿 (lǜ – green), 疟疾 (nüèjí – malaria).

One thing I noticed in my mandarin class is most students would pronounce the ü sound wrong, most like how we pronounce “you” in the english language.
