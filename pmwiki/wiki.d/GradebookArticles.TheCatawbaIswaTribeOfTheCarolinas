The Catawba tribe are the traditional stewards of this land centered around the Catawba River in central/western NC and parts of SC and southern Virginia. The name of the tribe in their native language is Yį Įsuwą h’reh, which means “people of the river” in Catawba. There are variations in the romanization of Įsuwą, including essa, issa, and iswa. The name for their land is Mánu: Yį Įsuwą, which means “land of the river people.” According to the official Catawba Nation website, their name should be pronounced like “yeh is-WAH h’reh”, for which the IPA transcription is /yeɪ is’wɔ hreɪ /.%0a%0aThe Treaty of Nations Ford (1840) was the primary treaty relating to the land in question, which stated that the Catawbas relinquish their land (144,000 acres) to the state government of South Carolina in exchange for yearly financial compensation and the promise of land in a less populated area. There is not much more information on other treaties relating to the Catawba Nation and their land, but it is worth noting that King Hagler, the chief of the tribe between 1750 (or 1754, there are conflicting dates) and 1763, “firmly believed in the treaties that were created to protect his people.”%0a%0aUnfortunately, I could not find any information about the status of the language and its native speakers on the official website; it seems that official events and meetings held by the nation are conducted entirely in English. There is, however, a large section devoted to preserving cultural heritage which mentions dance and drumming, which suggests that even if there are not large-scale efforts to preserve the Catawba language, there are certainly efforts to preserve other important aspects of the culture. It is possible that the language may be used at these cultural events. To give a ballpark estimate of how many native speakers there may be of the language, there are 3000 enrolled tribal citizens, so the number of native speakers should be some fraction of this number.%0a%0aThe Wikipedia article includes the same information on the Treaty of Nations Ford, and states that the Catawba tribe is “now working to revive the Catawba language.” According to another website (linked at the bottom), the language has not been spoken widely by the community since the 1940s. This website also includes resources to Catawba vocabulary, legends, and history. Much of the historical information on Wikipedia lines up with what is on the official Catawba Nation website – this includes the longtime reputation of the Catawba tribe as fierce warriors, the alliance of the tribe with the English during the French and Indian War, the way the smallpox epidemic impacted the tribe’s numbers, and the tribe’s federal status. %0a%0aThe Wikipedia article seems to be written from the perspective of an outsider and discusses the relationships among the various tribes in the region. I think the presentation of the struggles which the tribe faced is very different between the two websites; the official nation website personalizes the struggles by discussing the various hardships the tribe has faced over the course of centuries, and does a good job showing the resilience of the tribe. If I had only read the Wikipedia article, I might have had the impression that the membership of the tribe (and its cultural traditions) was on the decline, but after reading the official nation website, I believe many who are currently members of the nation are fighting hard to make sure the Catawba people don’t lose parts of their culture which are very important to them. %0a%0aSources:%0a%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/catawba.htm %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catawba_people %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
