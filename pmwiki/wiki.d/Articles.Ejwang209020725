Membership in the USA Pickleball Association since the organization’s inception in 2005 has undergone sustained exponential growth since 2013, surpassing 50,000 players in 2020 (1).

Curious, I purchased a set of pickleball equipment a year or two ago and began to play. I suppose that was when the game hadn’t yet picked up here in Pittsburgh (or at least in Franklin Park); now, it’s nearly impossible to find a court.

In particular, what do we call someone who plays pickleball? The most obvious answer is “pickleballer,” a term which does not exist in the Oxford English Dictionary. It’s worth noting that “pickleball” does exist in the OED (2), indicating that it wouldn’t be a stretch to include “pickleballer.” Evidently the sport is sufficiently played to warrant the addition of this new term. Moreover, the game does not seem to be a passing fad, as suggested by its sustained growth throughout a relatively long period of time.

Yet the term basketballer does not exist in the OED, and as far as I know, isn't used casually either, with players simply being referred to as basketball players. Furthermore, one of the criteria is widespread use, and the term pickleballer, as you've written yourself, doesn't appear to have seen widespread use as of now.
