Originally, when first discovered (when colonists settled in Jamestown in 1607), their population was around 10,000 people (1). The Manahoac tribe had little contact with the English, and no explorers or colonists remained to learn the language (1). Therefore, there are no known treaties that were made directly with the Manahoac tribe. Soon, due to disease, the Manahoac tribe’s population decreased dramatically, and surviving members joined allied tribes (5).%0a%0aThe language they used is still widely unknown, but it was most likely Tutelo–Saponi, a Siouan language spoken in Virginia (2). The last known fluent speaker died in the 1990s, and only a few people know the language today, which makes it extinct. However, there are efforts to revive the language, with the purpose of preserving the Manahoac culture. Additionally, the Living Tongues Institute is also working on a Tutelo-Saponi Monacan Living Dictionary that should be finished in late 2023 (3). We know a little bit about the Tutelo-Saponi language, including its sentence structure (which is subject-object-verb), morphology (suffixing and affixing), etc (4). %0a%0aIf we were to write a summary of this language based only on non-Indigenous resources, a lot of the inferences we make about the language might be driven by our perception of our own native language: English. For instance, we look at aspects of language such as affixation and sentence structure (4), since those concepts are important in the English language. Especially since little is known about the Tutelo-Saponi Monacan language, we cannot make these inferences.%0a%0aReferences:%0a(1) https://www.monacannation.com/our-history.html%0a(2) http://www.native-languages.org/tutelo.htm %0a(3) https://livingtongues.org/tutelo-saponi-monacan-grant/ %0a(4) https://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_tte %0a(5) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manahoac %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)%0a(:Title: The Manahoac Tribe:)
