He then dismissed her by sarcastically asking if there was anyone else with a question formulated in French.%0a%0aAfter doing some research, I found two main differences between Southern and Northern French accents, although there are definitely more differences than mentioned here. Firstly, if “e” appears at the end of a syllable, it is pronounced for Southern accents but not for a Northern accent. For instance, in the video, Mélenchon imitated the reporter by pronouncing “qu’est-ce que”(what) as [kɛsə] [kə] in a Southern French accent, instead of [kɛs] [kə]. Secondly, Southern accents tend to pronounce word-final alveolar nasals further back in the mouth, often producing a velar nasal instead. For instance, “parfaitement” would change from [pæfetmẽn] in a Northern accent to [pæfetəmeŋ] in a Southern accent.%0a%0aIn France, there is heavy discrimination towards regional French accents. Speaking with an accent other than the standard Parisian French accent could affect the types of employment that are open to you, such as jobs in broadcasting, civil service, academia and telemarketing. This is because in France, regional accents considered less professional. This perception stems from the prestige associated with the region of Paris. Historically, Paris was the place of residence for French kings and writers of major French dictionaries as well as the place where the biggest media outlets are located. On the other hand, regional accents were ruthlessly clamped down on in schools during the French Third Republic. Teachers were tasked to “correct the flaws in pronunciation or local accent”. In fact, the situation has become so serious that a law was passed in November 2020 to disallow discrimination based on accents in France, an act termed la glottophobie.%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.thelocal.fr/20200708/france-regional-accents-parisian-why-are-french-people-so-snobbish-when-it-comes-to-regional-accents/%0ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/2d6hqm/apenthetic_%25C5%258B_after_nasalized_vowels_in_southern/%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQlz_bbpzw%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210425-171404-202980#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!French Language Discrimination against Americans %0a-> - NickG%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aIt is interesting to hear about this discrimination in France towards regional accents, because it is similar to how, on a global level, France is attempting to maintain the French language in a very prescriptivist way.

In this instance, "charcuterie" is being adopted into American English as a loan word, and as such it has a different pronunciation because American English speakers naturally have different sounds available to them than native French speakers.
