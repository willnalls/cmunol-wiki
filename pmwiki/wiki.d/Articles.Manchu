It is the traditionally native language of the Manchu people, an ethnic minority in China, however most Manchu people now only speak Mandarin Chinese. It was one of the official languages of the Qing dynasty, however the usage of the language declined throughout the Qing dynasty and eventually led to it becoming endangered.%0a%0aSince there are only less than 20 native speakers worldwide, the language is considered critically endangered and is classified as between EGIDS 6b-9 on Ethnologue. It should be considered level 8b because as of 2007, the last 18 native speakers were of the grandparent generation. Several thousand people speak Manchu as a second language because of primary education and other classes in China.%0a%0aThe Manchu language started off as the primary language at the Qing Imperial court, but as time passed, these Manchu officials spoke it less and less. These officials increasingly only spoke Chinese and not Manchu to the point in which the only documents written in Manchu were memorials for the emperor. Thus, at the end of the Qing dynasty most Manchus could no longer speak their language and the Beijing dialect of Chinese replaced it because of the influence from the nation that they were in despite the incentives from the Qing government. After the Qing dynasty ended, most Manchu speakers were scared to speak it because the Han people were in charge of China again. Nowadays, Mandarin Chinese is needed to work and live in modern-day China.%0a%0aThere are revitalization efforts in place that are linked to the reconstruction of the ethnic Manchu identity in China. This began in the post-Mao era and now has support from many NGOs and other minority ethnic groups in China. These organizations offer classes at primary schools and universities, using it as a mechanism to teach reading of Qing dynasty texts. However, there are still many difficulties because China is a Han-dominated country and is still thought of as a foreign language.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.lakeforest.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/environmental-studies/the-manchu-language%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_language%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-213522-582430#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Revitalization Efforts of the Manchu Language and What It Means  %0a-> - yuluz%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aToday, the Chinese government and some ethnic Manchurians are becoming more conscious about saving the Manchu Language. By simply googling about saving Manchu language online, we can find quite a few documentaries and news articles by the Chinese central media on the issue (links attached at the end). %0a%0aOne of the most widespread language revitalization effort is by Tan Shanshan, a cultural inheritor of the Manchu language. He opened both online and offline classes in China to help save the language. The hashtag for his online classes earned 160 million views on China's social media Weibo, with many Chinese netizens saying they support the conservation of China's ethnic minority languages. %0a%0aHowever, given the prevalence of Mandarin in China today, I think it is nearly impossible for people to begin use the Manchu language in daily interactions again even after they have learned it. I agree with many scholars that the importance of preserving this language lies more in its research value. Since the Manchu language was one of the official languages of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty(1644-1911), many scripts and documents from that time period were written in this language. Thus, preserving the language is critical for the study of that 300 years of history in China. %0a%0aReports on revitalization efforts of the Manchu Language:%0a1.

They are unmarked, so the bare stem of a noun is also the nominative noun.%0a2. Genitive nouns are used to modify other words. They are marked by appending "i", unless the bare stem ends with "ng", in which case "ni" is added separately from the noun (e.g. niyalma -> niyalmai, tsang -> tsang ni).%0a3. Accusative nouns are typically direct objects. They are denoted by adding "be" separately (e.g. buda -> buda be).%0a4. Dative nouns are typically indirect objects. They're formed by adding "de", either through suffixation (unless the terminal consonant of the bare stem is not "n") or written separately (e.g. orin -> orin de, boo -> boode). %0a5.

In Fuyu county in China, this policy resulted in the establishment of a Manchu school, where young students learn the Manchu language and culture.
