This is illustrated in the way they use the word "SET". It is commonly used to signify acts concerning organization and arrangement of objects, but is also often used denote acts of violence, destruction, and battle. It is easy to see that acts of organization and teamwork in Nacireman culture are habits derived from the notions of order, discipline, and hierarchy imprinted on Nacireman soldiers. These habits are often taught to children using the song "Clean Up, Clean Up", which we think is probably a repurposed war ballad. %0a%0aSources:%0a%0aMerriam-Webster Dictionary ("set"): https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/set%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
