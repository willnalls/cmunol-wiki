Hong Kong English / Chinglish also has “open / close” a light.

This is also likely a result of direct, literal translation from Chinese to English, as in “看(look) 电影(film)” “看(look)书(book)” “看(look)那(that)只(counter, referring to a small, animate object) 鸟(bird)”%0a%0aAn example of a non-verb being literally translated in Chinese is “add oil”, which is an expression used as an encouragement and support to a person, literally 加(add) 油(oil). This expression has been been recognized by more and more people by speakers of standard English. A more well-known example is “long time no see,” which corresponds to the Chinese expression “好久(long time) 不(no) 见(look/see) “ in Mandarin or “好耐(long time) 冇 (no)見 (see)” in Cantonese. The expression “lose face” is directly transliterated from 丢(lose/throw away) 脸(face) to mean suffering a loss of respect. Despite these differences, English spoken in Hong Kong is highly intelligible to listeners from elsewhere, so there’s not much of a barrier to understanding, just like the case of Indian English.%0a%0aSource:Pang, T.
