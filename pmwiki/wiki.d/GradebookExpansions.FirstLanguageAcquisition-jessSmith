In writing (which we don't learn until our later years), there are clean breaks to words shown through spaces. In speech, we often do not have this, with words running together or variable lengths of pauses between words. How do babies learn to tell these spaces between words and learn individual words? Although this may sound wild, babies tend to learn language due to their sensitivity in the statistical probabilities in our speech as we talk to them. %0aIn language, each word uses syllables in a particular order. Usually, the order of a syllable within a word is much more likely to occur than the order of syllables between words. This probability of the next syllable occurring after the given syllable is called transitional probability, and although babies are not doing any specific statistical work, they pay attention to the likelihoods of when syllables occur to determine when an individual word is said. So, if the transitional probability is low, this indicates a break in a word, as often the syllables we end words with will not be part of the same word. Conversely, if the transitional probability is high, this indicates the syllables are within the same word.%0aAs the original poster said, first language acquisition is confusing and still ambiguous. However, by looking at these properties of statistical learning, we can explain how babies learn to tell words apart and learn single units of words from the confusing speech signal. %0aReference:%0ahttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112001/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
