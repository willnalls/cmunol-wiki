ASL, American Sign Language, is used predominantly in the United States and in parts of Canada. LSF(French Sign Language) provided a basis for ASL, along with the dutch, german, Irish, Brazilian, and so on.  Comparing ASL with JSL(Japanese Sign Language), JSL uses more fingerspelling and much more mouthing to distinguish different signs than ASL. But while differences in ASL and JSL were expected, Britain and Australia also have their own sign language. Americans and British can understand each other under verbal communication since they share the common language English. But BSL(British Sign Langauge) and ASL separate and distinct languages that the speaker of ASL cannot fully understand BSL and vice versa. Even fingerspelling is different in that ASL uses one hand while BSL uses two hands.  This signifies that sign languages do not represent spoken languages and is highly influenced by the geographical locations and lines it develops. %0a%0a%0aReference%0ahttps://www.startasl.com/japanese-sign-language-jsl/#:~:text=Japanese%2520Sign%2520Language%2520(JSL)%2520is,not%2520mouthing%2520to%2520this%2520extent.%0ahttps://www.k-international.com/blog/different-types-of-sign-language-around-the-world/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210509-034348-971350#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Some concrete characteristics of different sign languages %0a-> - ruiranx%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI was curious about how fingerspelling differed between different sign languages, so I took a bit of a dive.
