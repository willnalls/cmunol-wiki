With its origins in the Uighur language unity, Khakas is a language with several dialects spoken in Southern Siberia. Its modern speakers mostly speak one unified dialect, and the language is transcribed in a Cyrillic script [1].%0a%0aLike many of the languages of the Steppe, Khakas's endangerment is due primarily to Russian settler colonialism of Central Asia. Dating back to the 1700s, Russian territorial expansion eastward was similar to American expansion westward. The land was settled by ethnic Russians who largely displaced, killed, or assimilated native populations. While Khakas was formerly a widely spoken language, and in fact, a family of languages, Khakas has only 6000 speakers today [1].%0a%0aLanguages that are no longer spoken also threaten the cultures that they are a part of, so I also choose to highlight a Khakas cultural artefact: the epic poem "Khan Mirgen." The poem was passed down through the Khakas oral tradition, and is believed to be at least 1500 years old. The story spans three generations of heroes, whose values include "honesty, harmony with nature, devotion to and protection of one’s homeland, defense of the vulnerable, belief in justice, bravery, virtue, consciousness, male-female equality, as well as preservation of one’s native culture and traditions at a societal level" [2]. Hopefully in bringing attention to works like these, we can bring visibility to the native cultures of Khakas-speaking peoples and prevent the erasure of their way of life.%0a%0a[1] http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/2434%0a[2] http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/2434/samples/6493%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210506-160816-678540#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Another source of information about Khakas %0a-> - JasonE%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aBelow is a link to a website that further describes the language of Khakas.

The website says that the Khakas language began using the Cyrillic alphabet to write in 1924. Then the written language made the transition to the Latin alphabet between 1929 and 1939. Then after 1939, a revised Cyrillic alphabet was used to write the language. The sample text is written using the Khakas Cyrillic alphabet, which shows that it is still used in favor of the Latin alphabet today. In addition, at the bottom of this comment I have included a link to the wikipedia page for Khakas. I have included this link because it has a section dedicated to the phonology of Khakas. One interesting thing in the phonology of Khakas is that the only open vowel in the language is when the position of the tongue is in the back of the mouth. In comparison to English, we can have open vowels when the tongue position is either in the back or the front of the mouth. %0a%0aSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khakas_language  %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210511-182151-369010#%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: A:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)
