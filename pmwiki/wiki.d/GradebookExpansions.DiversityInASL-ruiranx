Below is a smattering of different languages from an article I found [1].%0a%0a1. American Sign Language (ASL), as mentioned in Kyuwon's article, is a one-handed fingerspelling language, but lexical signing (where signs communicate words) is two-handed.%0a%0a2. British Sign Language (BSL), as also mentioned above, is primarily a two-handed fingerspelling language, but there also exists a secondary one-handed fingerspelling system (which originated in Ireland).%0a%0a3. Japanese Sign Language (JSL) has manual representations for not only hiragana (one of the Japanese lettering systems) but also for lexical units. It is apparently one of the younger sign languages [2], and notably makes use of mouthing.%0a%0a4. Dutch Sign Language (DSL) is considered a "mouth-hand system", and the signs used are much more "iconic" in that they resemble the lexical units being described. DSL's usage of mouthing was proven to be an integral part of the language as opposed to being a complementary facet; research showed that mouthing was actually contrastive in the language.%0a%0a[1] https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/signlanguagediversity3.htm%0a%0a[2] http://www.deaflibrary.org/jsl.html%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000934-169150#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000934-169150#
