I had a great grandmother on my father's side who was full Navajo, so I believe I have 1/16th Navajo but that side of my family died when my father was young so neither myself or my father have had any kind of connection to the Navajo. The name listed on native-land.ca is the full name of Diné Bikéyah [dineɪ bikeɪʊ], but as I said before the more commonly known name is Navajo [navʊhoʊ] or the shortened form: Diné which means 'the people'. The Navajo reservation land is established from an 1868 treaty of a square piece of land on the Utah-New Mexico-Arizona border and was progressively expanded outwards over the years to be 27000 square miles, which is bigger than 10 US states. The Navajo language, full name Diné Bizaad but shortened also to Diné, is a native language that is alive and well as it is still spoken regularly amongst the Navajo people and used for official purposes such as Council meetings. It has around 150,000 speakers with a wide variety of resources on the language available today.%0a%0aThe Navajo Nation is the largest native reservation in the United States, having  27000 square miles and more than 300,000 members. While most Navajo members speak English, the Navajo language is spoken throughout the region. The Navajo speak a language called Diné bizaad, 'the people language', which is a Na-Dené Southern Athabaskan language. Although they are officially known as the Navajo, their original name is Diné Bikéyah, Navajo is a term that comes from Spanish missionaries and settlers who used this term for the Pueblo people. The Navajo and Apache are closely related and are believed to have both migrated down into the Southwestern United States region from Eastern Alaska and Canada. The majority of Athabaskan speakers still reside in Alaska and Canada and can still mostly understand Navajo despite their differences due to the shared linguistic heritage. The Navajo people were forcibly relocated by the Army to Fort Sumner, New Mexico in a 300 mile trek known as the Long Walk where they were interned at  Bosque Redondo. During this period there was a sever lack of resources as the government failed to provide them with adequate water supply. Additionally, the Mescalero Apache were also relocated to the area and conflict broke out as they were longtime enemies of the Navajo. Navajo leaders brokered a the treaty of Bosque Redondo in 1868 which gave them a reservation back on a portion of their homeland. This reservation was steadily expanded over time to what is now 27000 square miles that is the Navajo Nation today.%0a%0aThe facts from the non-indigenous source compared to the indigenous sources seemed to line up. The difference in presentation would be that the Wikipedia seems to have a more linear timeline structure to the information provided. On the topic of the language, the Wikipedia source took a very academic approach and described the language in its relation to other native languages and its language groupings which I didn't get from the indigenous sources. It also didn't include the current numbers of speakers and how it is used in official capacities by the Navajo Nation. Overall though, it seemed like the non-indigenous source was a good source for information I was looking for on the language since it had its own dedicated section with what appears to be accurate information with even more information than some of the native sources on the language in particular.%0a%0aLINKES:%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/navajo.htm%0ahttps://www.navajo-nsn.gov/history.htm%0ahttps://utahdinebikeyah.org/%0ahttps://native-land.ca/maps/territories/navajo/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
