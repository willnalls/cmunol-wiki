The language is very similar to Old Tamil with some influence from Kannada, and uses the Tamil writing system. It has around 12,000 speakers, and although its EGIDS classification is not available, Ethnologue lists it as a mid-sized endangered language with classification somewhere in the range 6b to 9, meaning that children no longer normally use and learn the language.%0a%0aDue to the close similarities to Tamil, some people argue that Irula is just a dialect and not its own language, contributing to some stigma around its use. This is partially because it is considered a more crude and less prestigious dialect due to its influence from other South Indian languages. Thus, Irula people typically do not speak the language outside of their own communities. They still use the language when practicing cultural traditions such as the dance and music performed in rituals, but this is mostly upheld by elderly members of the tribe. Their practices and language have been changing over time due to influence from other groups. However, funding has been put into revitalization programs, though I was unable to find specific information about such programs.%0a%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/language/iru%0ahttps://indiantribalheritage.org/?p=30724#gsc.tab=0%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210507-161148-390820#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!An Irula Folksong %0a-> - sanjana_m%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aWhen I was younger, I actually visited an area in which people spoke this language, and at the time, I did not know that it was different than Tamil, which was spoken in all the surrounding areas.
