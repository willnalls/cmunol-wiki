It is easier to round the lips when the tongue is raised closer to the roof of the mouth, since the mouth is open to a smaller extent. As such, WALs has four categories for front rounded vowels, with none of them including low front rounded vowels. Most languages fall in the “None” category, meaning that front rounded vowels do not exist in the language. 23 languages fall in the “High and mid” category, which suggests that there is at least one front rounded vowel produced at both the high and mid tongue height that is recognized in the language. The last two categories are “High only” and “Mid only”, which contains languages that only have either high or mid front rounded vowels.%0a%0aEnglish has 15 vowels while Albanian has 7 vowels, which is half that of English. According to the WALs online chapter on front rounded vowels, front rounded vowels tend to appear in “vowel systems with a larger than average number of vowel qualities”, which applies to both English and Albanian. Interestingly, English seems to be an exception to this trend, as English has no front rounded vowels while Albanian has one front unrounded vowel, /y/.%0a%0aOne thing that I find interesting is that even though English has twice the number of vowels as those in Albanian, the variety comes in the form of diphthongs rather than the roundedness of monophthongs. However, front rounded vowels were part of Old and Middle English, but no longer exist in modern English. This makes me wonder why certain sounds were discarded for others and the factors behind changes in the phonetics of languages.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
