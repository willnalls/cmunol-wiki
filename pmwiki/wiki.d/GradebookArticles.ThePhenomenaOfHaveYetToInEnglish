In fact, I was surprised to even see that this phrase was on the list of phenomena provided, as it's something that I’ve heard people from all over the country say. This phrase, or different forms of the phrase, is used to refer to something that hasn’t been done yet. %0a%0aExamples of this phrase in use include: “She has yet to fix the curtains”, or “I am yet to see a dolphin.”%0a%0aEven though this phrase in general is used across many different demographics, there are certain variations that are only used in certain regions and my certain people, although there is no research supporting any geographic or demographic trends about which groups of people use which variations.%0a%0aOne main variation if have/be, or the difference between “have yet to” and “be yet to”. The difference between these two phrases is based on “though” movement. This happens when in certain sentences involving some contrast using the word “though”, changing the placement of the phrase will cause it to transform from the “have” version to the “be” version, or vice versa.%0a%0aAnother variation is “got yet to,” which is one that I have not heard before. This variation comes as a result of the exchange of “have” with “have got.” For example, some people say “I have to go,” versus “I have got to go”, or “I have 3 dogs”, versus “I have got 3 dogs.” As a result of this, “have yet to” is often exchanged with “got yet to”, like “I’ve got yet to eat dinner.”%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
