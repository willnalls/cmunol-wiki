There are only 2,400 people globally that still speak Karo everyday. The Karo people live near the Omo river and sustain themselves through farming. They are very similar in terms of their style of living and their traditions to the Hamer people. The Hamer people speak the language Hamer-Banna, which has 81%25 lexical similarity to Karo. Overall, Karo has become endangered due to the fact that the Karo community is very small, so there is a low quantity of people speaking the language. Additionally, Karo is very similar to its surrounding languages, which often causes lesser-spoken languages to fizzle out and disappear. These two factors contribute to the endangerment of the Karo language.%0a%0aSource: https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12547/ET %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210507-154926-817900#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!On the Hamer-Banna %0a-> - Gavin_D%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aUnfortunately there doesn't seem to be much more information on the Karo language, but I did find some information on Hamer-Banna.%0a%0aIt has a larger population of speakers as already mentioned, about 74,000.
