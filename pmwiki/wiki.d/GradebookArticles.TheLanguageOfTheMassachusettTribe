It belongs to the Algonquian language family and was the first American Indian language to develop and use an alphabetic writing system. The Massachusett people, as well as most other peoples of New England who spoke a pidgin variety of the language as a regional lingua franca, referred to the language as Massachusett/Massachusee unnontoowaonk (IPA: /mɑːsatʃuːsət/mmɑːsatʃuːsiː ənãtuːaːãk/).%0a%0aMuch of the use of Massachusett was obstructed and destroyed by British colonizers.
