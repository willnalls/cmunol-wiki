It helps to find "linguistic cousins" or a language that is somehow related to the language you are attempting to decipher. An example of related languages are Spanish and Italian. These models find pairs related by sound correspondence at the character level and how regular these correspondences are. These sounds are plotted in a multidimensional graph where the distance between two points corresponds to how different the sounds are. This allows the model to show the evolutionary path taken by languages and allows the undeciphered language sounds to be mapped to similar known languages. The model currently works well to evaluate similarities between two languages but plans are being made to expand to multiple languages concurrently. %0a%0ahttps://thenewstack.io/this-ai-can-automatically-decipher-lost-ancient-languages/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
