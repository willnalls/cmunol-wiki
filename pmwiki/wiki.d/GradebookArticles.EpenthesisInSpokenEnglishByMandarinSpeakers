The typical syllable structure in Mandarin would be a simple onset with a nucleus of one or two vowels (CV,CVV) or a simple onset followed by a vowel and a nasal coda (CVC). %0a%0aThis structure causes Mandarin speakers to struggle a bit with pronouncing English syllables that start with complex onsets or end with non-nasal codas. The way they repair it is by inserting vowels in between consonants in the complex onset and after the coda. %0a%0aExamples of how Mandarin speakers use epenthesis to repair English words with complex onsets include: "fry" as [fuɹaɪ], “play” as [puleɪ], and “glad” as [gəlæd]. Examples of epenthesis after English coda include: "job" as [ʤɑbu], "check" as [ʧɛkə], “dog” as [dɔgə]. An example of epenthesis in both onset and coda in a single word is “great”, which tend to be pronounced as [guɹeɪtə] by Mandarin speakers. %0a%0aFrom these examples, we can see that the consonant cluster of an obstruent followed by a sonorant seem unnatural to Mandarin speakers and require insertion of a vowel to break them up. Furthermore, we see that [ə] is added after velar and alveolar plosives, while [u] is added after bilabial plosives /p/ and /b/.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
