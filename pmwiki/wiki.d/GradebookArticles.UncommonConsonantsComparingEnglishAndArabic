According to the World Atlas of Language Structures, languages fall into several categories of uncommon consonant sounds: clicks, labial-velars, pharyngeals, “Th” sounds, and combinations of these. Pharyngealization in particular is an articulation where the main body and root of the tongue pull back in the direction of the wall of the pharynx. The “Th” sounds refer to dental or alveolar fricatives, where the place of articulation is just behind or below the upper teeth and there is a slight flow of air unlike the stop manner of articulation in /t/.%0a%0aArabic is a language that exhibits pharyngealization. This primarily occurs in the form of these sounds: /ħ/, the voiceless pharyngeal fricative, and /ʕ/, the voiced pharyngeal fricative. English, in comparison, does not exhibit pharyngealization of consonants. Instead, the furthest back sound in English occurs near the larynx in the glottal stop /ʔ/. English, however, does have a “Th” sound.%0a%0aI wonder what causes certain languages to use a specific set of consonants. Why doesn’t English use a lot of pharyngealization? Why does Arabic use that specific sound? I wonder if pharyngeal sounds initially evolved as a way to describe a particular meaning. I also wonder why English skips over the pharyngeals straight to the larynx and glottal stops. Why did English evolve in that particular way. %0a%0aSources: https://wals.info/chapter/19, https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315147062-4%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
