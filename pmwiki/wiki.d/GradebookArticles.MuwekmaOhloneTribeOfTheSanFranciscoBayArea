The Muwekma, Muwékma, has a meaning "the People." The Native American Families originally owned parts of these lands with a formal Mexican Land grant before the American Conquest of California. In 1927, the government illegally terminated the right of the Muwekma Ohlone and other 135 tribal bands' access to the lands, leaving a mass group of landless tribes. Though in 1929-1932, the 1928 California Indian Jurisdictional Act help the surviving lineages claim settlements, this massive dismissal of so many tribal groups was a heartless behavior that has not yet been seen in any other states. %0a%0aThe Muwekma Ohlone Tribe Language Committee strives for the revitalization of their language. The Muwekma language is Chochenyo, Čočenyo that remained silent for 65 years prior to the establishment of the committee in 2002. Today there are no first-language speakers of Chochenyo. But efforts, such as workshops at San Jose State University to learn and revitalize the Chochenyo language, are being made to restore and enrich the lineage and traditions of the tribe. The pedagogical resources used are P. Harrington's fieldnotes. He is an anthropologist and a linguist, being one of the principal Chochenyo language informants, along with Jose Guzman and Maria de Log Angleles Colos. The notes attest to the language through the interview of at least 15 members of the Native American Languages between 1925 and 1930. There also exist songs that are in Chochenyo. %0a%0aThe Muwekma Oholone Tribe remains and will continue strong with their culture and traditions and their government that consists of the tribal councils, family of elders, committees and tribal administration. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
