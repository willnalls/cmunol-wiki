AmE speakers are also starting to use some of these adjectives in less casual contexts (such as the last example or "it works great" in a work email). There is a trend these forms being accepted more and more in the US and the UK, so some BrE speakers blame Americans for this "degradation" of the language. However, some British dialects already have had the same pattern. Additionally, the pattern has some rules and syntax of its own. %0a%0aFor one thing, only adverbs that modify verbs or other adverbs tend to be replaced with adjectives. Another interesting point is where in a sentence the adjective-adverbs can be used compared to regular adverbs.%0a%0aExamples (from https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/the-americans-have-no-adverbs):%0a[1] You should eat it up "quickly"(ADV) before someone else gets it.%0a[2] You should "quickly"(ADV) eat it up before someone else gets it.%0a[3] You should eat it up "quick"(ADJ) before someone else gets it.%0a[4] *You should "quick"(ADJ) eat it up before someone else gets it.%0a%0a[1] and [2] show that the adverb form can be placed before or after the verb "eat".
