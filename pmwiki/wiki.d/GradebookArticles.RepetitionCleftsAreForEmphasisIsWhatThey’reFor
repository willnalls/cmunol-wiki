They occur more frequently in spoken situations rather than written ones because they are ungrammatical. However, they are still acceptable in spoken situations because they are similar to wh-clefts:%0a    - Ex: “WHAT HE WANTS is A GOOD JOB”%0a    - Ex: “A GOOD JOB is WHAT HE WANTS”%0aRepetition clefts repeat the subject and verb of the clause the speaker wants to emphasize. They take 2 possible forms:%0a    1. Wh-phrase+ be/is + complete sentence %0a        - Ex: What he wants is HE WANTS A GOOD JOB%0a    2. Complete sentence + be/is + wh-phrase%0a        - Ex: HE WANTS A GOOD JOB is what he wants%0aA Wh-phrase begins with a question word (who, what, where, when, how). However, not all Wh-words are acceptable in repetition clefts. “what” is the most universally accepted Wh-word that can be used in repetition clefts. “who” and “which” are frequently considered unnatural or unacceptable to use in repetition clefts. Multiple wh-words can also be used:%0a    - Ex: WHO ordered WHAT is John ordered steak and Mary (ordered) salad.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
