(https://www.quora.com/Do-Chinese-know-better-English-than-Indian) The answer that got the most upvotes is written by the user “Rain,” in which he/she criticizes both Chinese people’s pronunciation when speaking English as being ungrammatical. To quote in his/her own words, “Chinese people’s English accent sucks. [They] have difficulty pronouncing some consonants.” (S)he claims that a large number of  Chinese confuse [ɹ], [l], and [n] when speaking English. The examples (s)he gives are “name” vs “lame”, “fruit” vs “flute”,  and “robe” vs “lobe”. (S)he also considers the different stress of Chinese English ungrammatical, saying that “they will often put the stress at the end of a word. kind of like - “Pawwa”, “Addhha” and so on.” %0a%0a%0aApart from if the comparison in the original Quora question is meaningful at all, this is a typical example of people being unaware of the presence of different English accents. The stance of the comment is very prescriptive in nature in that the author believes whatever differs from standard American accent is incorrect. The stresses of English words in Chinglish are indeed different from the standard accent, but from a descriptive point of view, this should be considered a characteristic of the Chinese accent instead of mistakes. Moreover, the points made in the comment are largely incorrect. The comment mentions that Chinese confuse [ɹ], [l], and [n], but all of the phonemes are present and contrastive in Mandarin, as well as in most other Sinitic languages.  [lɤ] “乐“, [ɹ] “热”, and [nɤ] ”呢“ is an example of a minimal pair. From my observation, most Chinese speakers of English don’t confuse these phonemes, but they do replace [θ] with [s] and  [ð] with [d] or [z], as many other English accents do. Unfortunately, this is the perspective that many native speakers of English have. Because most people haven’t been exposed to many other accents, they tend to think that only the standard variant is correct, while all other accents/vernaculars are “improper” versions of standard English. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210509-010647-405100#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!![l] and [n] are indeed not used in some Chinese dialects %0a-> - Simon_Y%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aJust wanted to mention that there are some dialects of Chinese that do not use [l] and [n] contrastively.
