While Wappinger is the only name of the original tribe that existed in the area, European disease and warfare in the area led to the remaining Wappinger people merging with other tribes such as the larger Mohican and Lenape, leading many to erroneously consider the Wappinger a subset of the Mohican and call them as such. (1) The IPA transcription of Wappinger is 'wɒpɪndʒər', though parts of this transcription and name, especially the '-er' suffix, may have originated from the Dutch slightly altering the name upon arrival.%0aThe first Wappinger encounters with Europeans occured in the early 1600s with Dutch and later English settlement in the region greatly reducing Wappinger population both due to European warfare and disease, and conflict with the nearby Iroquois tribe raiding their lands. The Wappinger were then officially removed from their lands on October 17th, 1685 with the unfair "Indian Deed of Sale" as part of the "Rombout Royal Patent" signed by King James II of England, selling 85,000 acres of Wappinger lands for $1200 worth of trade goods. Very few people identifying as Wappinger existed by the end of the Revolutionary War, in which the final Wappinger leader Daniel Nimham aided the American cause (1).%0aUnfortunately, both the Wappinger and their language are extinct due to these centuries of warfare and assimilation before the Revolutionary War. While not much is known about the Wappinger language, it was most likely a relative of either the Mohican or Lenape languages. However, the Mohican tribe, to which many Wappinger assimilated, does still have its language in use and has efforts by the tribe to teach the language to a new generation (3).%0aAfter looking at a non-Indigenous source on the Wappinger (2), while the facts stayed relatively consistent between sources I noticed a much different tone in presentation compared to the Indigenous source. While the non-Indigenous source spoke about the Wappinger very matter-of-factly, the indigenous source made sure to take care in emphasizing the human tragedy in the extinction of the Wappinger, repeatedly mentioning the hardship of the Wappinger people.%0a%0a%0a(1) https://mountgulian.org/history/the-wappinger-people/ %0a(2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wappinger%0a(3) https://www.mohican.com/services/cultural-services/language/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221127-235541-487940#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!The phonology and lexicography of Mohican, the language spoken by the Wappinger Tribe %0a-> - taylor000%0a-> [-27.11.2022 - 15:55-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221127-235541-487940 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aDisclaimer: I cannot find any Mohican resources produced by members of the Stockbridge Munsee Community, so this information stems from outside resources.
