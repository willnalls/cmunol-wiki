While many consonant sounds can be found across many languages, some consonants are very uncommon and are only found in a handful of languages around the world. These consonants are clicks (a type of non-pulmonic consonant), labial-velars (consonants articulated at both the lips and velum), pharyngeals (fricatives articulated in the pharynx), and ‘th’ sounds (dental fricatives). Each of these consonants are seen in fewer than 10%25 of the languages featured on the WALS map. %0a %0aBoth English and Dahalo have the uncommon ‘ð’ sound, while only English has the ‘θ’ sound according to Phioble. However, Dahalo also has both labial-velars and pharyngeals, and is the only language on the WALS map to contain three different uncommon consonants. %0a %0aFrom looking at the WALS map, I notice that clicks and labial-velars, and to some degree pharyngeals, are clustered in areas across the world. Labial-velars are almost exclusively found in the region of Africa just south of the Sahara desert, clicks are clustered in parts of Southern and Eastern Africa, and pharyngeals are mostly in Northern and Eastern Africa, the Caucasus region, the Pacific northwest, and Southeast Asia. It makes more sense then that Dahalo, being located in East Africa, would have both pharyngeals and clicks. However, the ‘th’ sounds do not seem to follow any clustering on the world map, so the fact that both English and Dahalo have them despite being far away from one another is not surprising. They are found sparsely scattered across all the continents and aren’t especially clustered in any one area. What makes the ‘th’ sounds different that they aren’t clustered while the other uncommon sounds mostly are?%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
