Audrey Hepburn's role in the movie and the soundtrack as well proved to be extremely iconic and to this day, pop-culturally significant. However, people often overlook the darker side of the film which is the harmful stereotyping of Japanese people and the Japanese American dialect. %0a%0aIn the film, the actor portraying the Japanese character Mr. Yunioshi is a caucasian male named Mickey Rooney. The features of the dialect which the actor chose to exaggerate in an effort to be comedic were things such as substituting the voiced alveolar lateral approximate [l] for the voiced alveolar approximate [ɹ], the voiced alveolar plosive [d] for the voiced dental fricative [ð]. Additionally, many sentences were formed in a way ungrammatical for standard American English speakers such as using the present tense of the verb "go" instead of the future tense "will go" in the sentence "I go to call the police". %0a%0aThe main criticism of this portrayal of a Japanese accent is that it was part of a character which furthered many harmful stereotypes of Japanese people. What's worse is that many people seem to overlook this fact when discussing this iconic and culturally significant movie. Although this movie was made during a time when the stereotyping and cultural appropriation was widely accepted and even entertaining, it is important to recognize the harmful effect that this character has on the perceptions of the Japanese community.%0a%0aLink to compilation of Mr. Yunioshi scenes in Breakfast at Tiffany's: https://youtu.be/Hb3gdUrIC4Q%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
