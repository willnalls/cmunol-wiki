The Kanien’kehá language was spoken by the Kanien’kehá:ka tribe, a member of the Haudenosaunee (commonly known as the Iroquois Confederacy) (1). Growing up in upstate New York, many of my elementary social studies classes were filled with learning about the Haudenosaunee, who had historically been a large trading partner with the Albany colonists.%0a%0aThe traditional stewards of the land were the Kanien’kehá:ka people (2). In present-day American society, they are more commonly known as the "Mohawk" tribe, although this name does not have roots in their native language, and some sources said that they preferred being called the Kanien’kehá:ka. An IPA transcription of Kanien’kehá would be [kanienʔkehá], where the [á] indicates tone (5).%0a%0aBefore the Europeans settled in America, the Kanien’kehá:ka society covered a lot of land, mainly settling in the Mohawk River Valley. They moved out of the valley and further north due to conflicts in the mid-1700s. In 1760, the treaty of Kahnawake was signed. In 1796, a treaty was signed between the Seven Nations of Canada (which included some Kanien’kehá:ka councils) and New York. This gave them more autonomy over their land, but also restricted them to less land (1).%0a%0aThrough my research, I couldn’t find a specific number of speakers of the language. This might be because current Kanien’kehá:ka society is made up of many different smaller councils and communities that reside in different reserves. I was able to find some figures for some of the communities, and it’s clear that the language is decreasing in speakers (5). There are some organizations that are working on reviving Kanien’kehá:ka culture, such as the Kanien’kehá:ka Onkwawén:na Raotitióhkwa Language and Cultural Center in Quebec, Canada (2). There also exist Kanien’kehá immersion programs in schools like those provided by the Kahnawà:ke Education Center (3) and the Mohawk Community of Akwesasne (4). These programs work to teach children the Kanien’kehá language and cultural practices, and give them support and resources. In doing so, they help keep their traditions and culture alive.%0a%0aThe non-indigenous resource that I looked at was omniglot.com (6). One key thing that I noticed was that it mentions the origins of the words “Mohawk” and “Kanien’kehá,” which I did not come across in the other sites. It says, “the native name for the Mohawk language, Kanien'keha, means 'people of the flint'. The term Mohawk comes from a name meaning 'man-eaters' used by their Algonquian enemies” (6). This is reflective of the conflicts between the Haudenosaunee and the Algonquin, and it's interesting that this name is the one that took root in our society. This source also says that in 2015-2016, there were around 3,000 speakers of the Kanien’kehá language in Canada and the US. The source that I used to understand the Kanien’kehá alphabet (5) also had audio recordings of each of the letters/sounds, while omniglot.com only had an IPA transcription of each (6). If I were to write a summary of the language based on non-indigenous sources, first of all, I would be referring to it using a name that comes from a group of people that the Kanien'kéha:ka had conflicts with. I also definitely wouldn’t be able to focus as much on the revitalization efforts, or be able to go in depth about the rich history of the language and its culture.%0a%0a%0aSources:%0a(1) https://www.srmt-nsn.gov/history_of_tribal_government%0a(2) https://www.korkahnawake.org/about %0a(3) https://www.kecedu.ca/about/message-from-the-director-of-education %0a(4) http://www.akwesasne.ca/history-resources/about-mca/ %0a(5) https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/Workspaces/Data/Kanehsat%25C3%25A0:ke/Mohawk/Kanien'k%25C3%25A9ha%2520(Mohawk)%2520Eng/learn %0a(6) https://omniglot.com/writing/mohawk.htm %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221023-184152-297340#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Modern Kanien'kéha Revitalization Efforts Through Video Games %0a-> - rubyd%0a-> [-23.10.2022 - 11:41-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221023-184152-297340 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aOne particularly interesting modern method of language revitalization that Indigenous educators have been utilizing is the video game industry, something which has aided Kanien'kéha early childhood education as well.

The Mohawk language was spoken by the Mohawk tribe, a member of the Iroquois Confederacy/the Haudenosaunee (1). Growing up in upstate New York, many of my elementary social studies classes were filled with learning about the Iroquois, who had historically been a large trading partner with the Albany colonists.%0a%3c %0a%3c The traditional stewards of the land were the Mohawks, also known as the Kanien’kehá:ka in the Mohawk language (which is called Kanien’kehá) (2). An IPA transcription of Kanien’kehà would be [kanienʔkehá], where the [á] indicates tone (5).%0a%3c %0a%3c Before the Europeans settled in America, the Mohawk society covered a lot of land, mainly settling in the Mohawk River Valley. They moved out of the valley and further north due to conflicts in the mid-1700s. In 1760, the treaty of Kahnawake was signed. In 1796, a treaty was signed between the Seven Nations of Canada (which included some groups of Mohawks) and New York. This gave them more autonomy over their land, but also restricted them to less land (1).%0a%3c %0a%3c Through my research, I couldn’t find a specific number of speakers of the language. This might be because current Mohawk society is made up of many different smaller councils and communities that reside in different reserves. I was able to find some figures for some of the communities, and it’s clear that the language is decreasing in speakers (5). There are some organizations that are working on reviving Mohawk culture, such as the Kanien’kehá:ka Onkwawén:na Raotitióhkwa Language and Cultural Center in Quebec, Canada (2). There also exist Kanien’kehá immersion programs in schools like those provided by the Kahnawà:ke Education Center (3) and the Mohawk Community of Akwesasne (4). These programs work to teach children the Mohawk language and cultural practices, and give them support and resources. In doing so, they help keep their traditions and culture alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c The non-indigenous resource that I looked at was omniglot.com (6). One key thing that I noticed was that it mentions the origins of the words “Mohawk” and “Kanien’kehá,” which I did not come across in the other sites. It says, “the native name for the Mohawk language, Kanien'keha, means 'people of the flint'. The term Mohawk comes from a name meaning 'man-eaters' used by their Algonquian enemies.” This source also says that in 2015-2016, there were around 3,000 speakers of the Mohawk language in Canada and the US. The source that I used to understand the Mohawk alphabet (5) also had audio recordings of each of the letters/sounds, while omniglot.com only had an IPA transcription of each (6). If I were to write a summary of the language based on non-indigenous sources, I definitely wouldn’t be able to focus as much on the revitalization efforts, or be able to go in depth about the rich history of the language and its culture. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sources:%0a%3c https://www.srmt-nsn.gov/history_of_tribal_government%0a%3c https://www.korkahnawake.org/about %0a%3c https://www.kecedu.ca/about/message-from-the-director-of-education %0a%3c http://www.akwesasne.ca/history-resources/about-mca/ %0a%3c https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/Workspaces/Data/Kanehsat%25C3%25A0:ke/Mohawk/Kanien'k%25C3%25A9ha%2520(Mohawk)%2520Eng/learn %0a%3c https://omniglot.com/writing/mohawk.htm %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#contentends]]%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expansions:%0a%3c [[#expansions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#expansionsend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c You must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%3c %0a%3c (:else:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Comments%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a%3c !!Change article category%0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:Section: B:)%0a%3c (:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)%0a%3c (:Title: The Mohawk Tribe:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
