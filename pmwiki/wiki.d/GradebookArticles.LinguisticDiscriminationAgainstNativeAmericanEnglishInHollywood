The style is often a fabricated over-generalization, despite the fact that true Native American English (or American Indian English (AIE)) is not at all homogenous. %0a%0aIn terms of morphosyntax, there are four primary grammatical markers used in HIE:%0a%0a1. Lack of tense - HIE often deletes auxiliary or modal verbs, resulting in the deletion of tense marking. E.g: A line of HIE dialogue in the movie, ’Quantum Leap’, is “We go home together” (which in SAE would likely translate to “We will go home together”). The reason for this fictional representation could be that some varieties of AIE have a lack of verb markers, such as “-ed” and “-s”, and omit verbs such as “be”, “get” and “have”. However, verb constructions in AIE are still very variable according to tribe.%0a2. Deletion - HIE sometimes deletes subject and object pronouns, auxiliary verbs, and noun determiners - again, this is perhaps due to some (but not all) dialects of AIE - such as Mohave and Ute English - deleting pronouns. This is a feature that also marks “baby talk” and “foreigner talk”.%0a3. Substitution - HIE sometimes replaces the subject pronoun with an object pronoun or a full noun (e.g: the line “Me go find and give him courage” from the film ‘Maverick’). This feature seems less to be adapted from true variants of Native American English, and more a feature of “baby talk” and “foreigner talk”%0a4. Lack of contraction - Again, this is a feature that is commonly used in fictional representations of foreigners, rather than being a reflection of Native American speech itself%0a%0aAs seen in the features above, HIE tends to homogenize AIE. Even features that are present in some variants of AIE tend to be used in conjunction with grammatical markers of “baby talk” and “foreigner talk”, which depicts Native Americans as childlike, uncivilized, and foreign. It is also worth noting that many of the grammatical features incorporated into HIE are those that are generally deemed to be “incorrect” or “ungrammatical”, showing Native Americans to be intellectually inferior.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-in-society/article/and-the-injun-goes-how-representations-of-american-indian-english-in-white-public-space/8BD38E091D5603F7AC58C86011FF8045%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_English%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
