However, all of the consonants in English are pulmonic, meaning that the consonants are produced through the ejection of air from the lungs. But, pulmonic sounds do not make up all of the consonant sounds a person can produce.%0a%0aZulu, for example, also makes uses of non-pulmonic consonants, mainly clicks. Non-pulmonic consonants are a lot less common in spoken languages but are still seen in various. Clicks in particular are seen in various languages originating in southern Africa, according to WALS. Clicks are pretty much what they sound like. Rather than producing sounds by vibrating the vocal folds, the tongue is pressed against a part of the mouth and then quickly released, creating a clicking sound. There (at least when I try to click, but I do not speak a language that involves any kind of non-pulmonic, so take this with a grain of salt) is no dependence on airflow, the click sound is more dependent on tongue placement than anything else. As such, there are different types of clicks, categorized based on where the tip of the tongue is pressed. Zulu has a dental click, a lateral click, and a retroflex click. %0a%0aOne question that I have about the presence of clicks in Zulu is how it changes syllable construction. It is probably because because I am not used to clicking, but I noticed that the configuration that my tongue was in to click meant that transitioning from a click to certain other sounds was a bit awkward. SO I wonder what segments in Zulu are allowed and how that compares to languages like English that do not have clicks. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts%0a:Title: Presence of Uncommon Consonants: Comparing English and Zulu%0a:Author: ZoeC%0a:Section: EE%0a:Completed: 20.02.2021 - 14:14%0a:Status: ungraded%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aEnglish contains the uncommon dental fricative “th” sound, while languages like Zulu contain various types of clicking. %0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aThe phonetic contrasts of uncommon consonant sounds are very prevalent across the globe, especially in languages such as English and Zulu. I understand uncommon consonants as consonant features that are unique to just a couple languages across the world. This can include anything like clicks, pharyngeals, labial-velars, the “th” sound, and even rarer are different combinations of these within the same language. These features may be uncommon for different reasons including geographical context, genetics, or even that these certain consonants require more muscular force.%0a %0aFor this article, I have chosen to examine the contrasts between Zulu (a South African language) and English in terms of their respective uncommon consonants. For instance, English has the uncommon “th” sound, otherwise known as the dental fricative. This dental fricative category includes both the unvoiced [θ] and the voiced [ð], and is present in only around 43 languages. The Zulu people don’t have dental fricatives, but they frequently use clicks in their language. Zulu contains 4 different clicks: the bilabial P click [ʘ], the dental C click [ǀ], the palatoalveolar X click [ǂ], and the postalveolar [ǃ] Q click. Clicking is only present in around 9 languages in the world! More information and pronunciation can be found in this native speaker’s video:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHHGOYu6Fl0%0a %0aClicks are produced by a sucking action of the tongue, or in technical terms, with a lingual ingressive airstream mechanism. Zulu clicking produces some of the loudest consonants in any language, while languages like Sandawe and Hazda have more subtle clicking, often mistaken for ejectives. In contrast, the English dental fricative is produced by the tip of the tongue being placed behind the top front teeth, paired with passage of air either with the vocal folds vibrating (producing [ð]), or resting (producing [θ]).%0a %0aI found it interesting that some linguists think that the reason clicking is so uncommon is because it requires more muscular force than other consonants (some clicks require suction of the tongue). They also found that it is also more common in people with smaller alveolar ridges. These findings left me wondering; can infants just as easily acquire clicking as they can the English dental fricative, or is it more difficult because they don’t have the developed muscular structures? %0a %0aSources:%0a%0ahttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-click-speech-is-rare/#:~:text=Click%2520sounds%252C%2520such%2520as%2520those,Africa%252C%2520make%2520perfectly%2520good%2520consonants.&text=These%2520allowed%2520less%2520air%2520to,an%2520anatomical%2520bias%2520against%2520clicks.%0a %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant#:~:text=Anatomically%252C%2520clicks%2520are%2520obstruents%2520articulated,a%2520lingual%2520ingressive%2520airstream%2520mechanism%0a %0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHHGOYu6Fl0%0a %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----
