Even now, this violence has continued and Asian/Asian-American individuals are prejudiced against in society. One issue that has been greatly overlooked is internal language discrimination. In Hong Kong, 90%25 of the population speaks Cantonese. Although Mandarin is the official language of China, it is perceived as an “outsider’s tongue”. Hong Kong natives would recognize the difference between the two dialects (Mandarin has 4 tonal sounds instead of the 6 in Cantonese, Mandarin has simpler characters whereas Cantonese has the complex traditional ones, etc.) and discriminate against those that spoke a different dialect.

Even though I was exposed to both languages, I am only fluent in Mandarin and can only understand Cantonese to a certain extent. This is mainly due to the fact that my parents prioritized my education my Mandarin over Cantonese, due to the common usage of Mandarin in China. As I have seen from others of Chinese nationality, Cantonese is often noted by them to be loud and exaggerated. This brought me to question such logic, as I was curious how exactly this ideology was created. On main thing that I noticed (note that this may not be true as I am not a fluent Cantonese speaker) is that the extra two tones in Cantonese causes common day expressions to sound very exaggerated. To an extent, such extraneous tones may also have a correlation to being louder. In addition, I have also noticed many ideas that Cantonese is an ugly sounding language in comparison to Mandarin. I would like to note that these are just observations I have heard from others and I do not commit to these statements as facts.
