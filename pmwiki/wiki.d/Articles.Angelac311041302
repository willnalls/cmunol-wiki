It is spoken in regions of the Sichuan Province in China (1). It is reported that there are around 5,000 native speakers and only 200 people who speak solely Namuyi (1). Namuyi has an EGIDS level of around 5-6a,  which means that it is not sustained by formal institutions, but people speak it in their communities and children learn it (3). Namuyi is well-preserved in some villages, where only people aged twenty and less with a primary school education can speak Chinese. (Everyone else speaks Namuyi.) However, in other villages, it is mostly spoken by people who were born before 1955 (2). While people speak it with community and family members, the population, especially the younger generation, prefers to speak the Sichuan dialect of Chinese (2). In fact, more and more teenagers are beginning to not understand Namuyi. While interviewing speakers of the language, they mention that because people feel like there is no need to understand and speak Namuyi, people are using it less and less (2). Children are being taught Chinese instead of Namuyi, because parents believe it will allow them to have better lives and get better jobs outside their village in the future (2).%0a%0aSources:%0a(1) https://www.elararchive.org/dk0217/ %0a(2) https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/21 %0a(3) https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nmy %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221130-075543-602870#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Namuyi %0a-> - benjaminlu%0a-> [-29.11.2022 - 23:55-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221130-075543-602870 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGZ43LoUB84%0a(Link to recording of Namuyi)%0a%0aThe Namuyi group forms part of China’s officially-recognized Tibetan ethnic group.

Many argue that the Namuyi language is a Qiangic language that has been influenced by the Yi languages lexically, creating many variations of the language. There are many variations of Namuyi spoken in places such as Muli County and Luoguodi. According to research, when comparing the different variations of Namuyi in Muli and Luoguodi, some non-homonymous cognates differ in the occurrence of voicing and prenasalized stops.
