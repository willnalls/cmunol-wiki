The entrance process to these facilities is crowned by the dated and hated SAT. They lay completely sedentary during a four hour process as they deposit graphite onto thin rolled sheets of dead organic material. This is emphasized in the word “sat”, which is used all around their language to mean the sedentary aspects of life (a category crowned by the SAT). This wide use of “sat” along with the relentless gluttony displayed by the Nacirema lead me to believe they prize the sedate, even when their leaders attempt to convince them otherwise. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: C:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)
