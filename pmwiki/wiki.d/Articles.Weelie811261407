The traditional stewards of the lands are Ayoreo groups. They are called Ayoreo-Totobiegosode local group, or Ayoreo People. In the Ayoreo language, Ayoreo means “true people”. There are approximately 5,600 Ayoreo people in total. Around 3,000 live in Bolivia, and 2,600 live in Paraguay. There are no specific treaty regards to the land of Ayoreo Territoty. Since most of the Ayoreo people are nomandic, they don't really have too much contact with other Ayoreo people. The majority of the population was sedentarized by missionaries in the twentieth century. The few remaining uncontacted Ayoreo are threatened by deforestation and loss of territory.
