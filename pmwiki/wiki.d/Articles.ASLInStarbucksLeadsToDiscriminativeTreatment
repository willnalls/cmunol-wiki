Using ASL amongst other deaf people in the Starbucks apparently led to stares, complaints about not buying enough and not taking some deaf patrons orders. Some were even told to leave the coffeeshop. Based on the accounts of several people, it seems that the Starbucks employees are treating their deaf customers worse simply because they do not communicate in the manner that they expect. Singling out customers based on factors out of their control is clearly an issue. The article mentions sensitivity training for Starbucks employees was provided and I believe that this must be extended to more than just a small portion of their workers. Even if we can't expect all outlets to have someone capable of speaking to deaf customers in ASL, accepting orders in other form such as written or through text-to-speech must be more readily accepted and not looked down upon. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210501-063536-120#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-30.04.2021 - 23:35-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210501-063536-120 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!Abi_S%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''ASL discrimination'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aI've seen videos where they just think they're lying about being deaf :https://whatstrending.com/heartwarming-viral-tiktok-shows-how-starbucks-is-becoming-more-inclusive-to-deaf-community/ %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210501-063536-120#%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: B:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
