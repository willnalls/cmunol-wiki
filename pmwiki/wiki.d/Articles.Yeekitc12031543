Should you have visited this village in decades past, you may have heard trilling whistles resounding across the hilltops, clear and melodious, and you may have wondered at the kind of avian creature that emitted such sounds before discovering, with awe, that the whistles were a human language. %0a%0aThis village is called Antia, and the dying whistle language, known as sfyria, is now the most endangered European language known to exist, with six speakers left as of 2017. The villagers were traditionally goatherds, and they developed sfyria as a way of communicating across long distances when they had yet to acquire the conveniences of telephones and the Internet. Miraculously, the early inhabitants of Antia managed to completely translate the Greek language, down to the syllables and the letters, into a code of whistles, and then taught it to themselves and their posterity so that it became a language - a language infinitely more effective when it came to communicating across hilltops, for whistling can be heard up to ten times further away than shouting, which would have taken more effort, as well. However, as technology develops and the allure of the cities, with their modern comforts and conveniences, continue to draw the next generation out of Antia, there have been fewer and fewer people to carry on the torch of the whistle language, and as the few remaining speakers age, the hopes of keeping sfyria alive continue to dwindle. Seeing as sfyria is a language consisting solely of whistles, the quality of one's teeth is also a factor in the ability of one to speak it, and as the older speakers progress in their years, some have lost their ability to whistle, as well. As of 2017, the youngest speaker was well into his forties, and he was not even an Antia native; instead, he had heard of the wondrous language and traveled from his hometown especially to learn the code of whistles, and after learning, videos of his demonstration as well as those of the other five speakers were uploaded onto YouTube. Were the videos to go viral, I believe that the prospects of sfyria may improve, especially if a new wave of young people would be motivated to learn the language. %0a%0aSfyria is far from the only whistling language in the world, with others like it found across South America and Africa as well, but it is by far the most endangered. Though Greece has not yet filed sfyria as a critically endangered language despite its incredibly low number of speakers, some villagers of Antia have already taken steps in an effort to preserve their culture and language, the most prominent of which are those of Panagiotis Tzanavarisin. In 2014, he helped linguists from prominent universities Harvard and Yale to record the language for the sake of future generations, and in 2016, he and his fellow villagers filmed a short documentary for the MET in New York. %0a%0aSource: https://www.nomomente.org/post/sfyria-greek-whistling-language%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: The Dying Whistle of Sfyria:)
