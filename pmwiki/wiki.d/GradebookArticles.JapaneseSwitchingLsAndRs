It shows a Japanese man greeting someone getting off a plane and has a subtext that says “difficulties of pronouncing “L’s” in Japanese language.” In his speech bubble where there should be L’s there are R’s instead. It is sort of mocking how Japanese people sometimes pronounce English [l] sounds as the [ɹ] sound instead. %0a%0aThis pronunciation is considered ungrammatical because the the [l] sound is being substituted for the [r] sound. The Japanese language does not include the [ɹ] or [l] sounds, but includes the [ɾ] which is almost closer to the English [l] sound than the [ɹ] sound. Because the [ɹ] sound isn’t included in the Japenese language, it makes it difficult for them to hear and produce the sound. This explains why we often hear more of a [ɾ] sound instead, which in turn sounds like an [l].%0a%0aThis representation of Japanese people speaking English is in movies, shows, etc. that I’ve seen a few times myself. People poke fun at the way they pronounce English words because it sounds different than what we are used to, but I think people forget how hard it is to pronounce sounds that are foreign to your own language. I know there is a similar joke about how non native Japanese speakers pronounce the phrase “only speed is unbreakable” that is popular in Kung Fu movies. In Japanese it is pronounced like “wai faai bat po”, but English speakers say the first two words like “wifi”. This is a joke then that the wifi is super good because of the mispronunciation. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzMUs3badc%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
