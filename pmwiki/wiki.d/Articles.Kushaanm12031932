This is in part due to the fact that their brains are naturally wired to absorb new information better than someone older. However, it is also related to some linguistic phenomena.   %0a%0aOne is that they haven’t fully absorbed the ideas of syntax. For example, children take time to understand the complexities of tense, agreement, and sentence structure, which is why children often make grammatical mistakes. However, for adults, these are ingrained. As such, children are not bound to any one framework, whereas a monolingual adult is bound to their languages framework. Since syntactic ideas differ greatly between languages, a child is much better suited to learn multiple languages, since they can absorb each language's patterns better.%0a%0aWhat is interesting is that given a similar time frame, adults can achieve a better understanding of a new language than children, yet it is a less natural understanding. Due to more advanced problem solving experience, an adult can grasp the grammar better and learn more words, yet there are tells that they are not a native speaker. Whereas with children, it takes more time yet they end up with a better understanding. This shows how important the plasticity of a child’s brain is to the language learning process. Even though they don’t possess the same pattern skills, they can absorb what they do understand much better.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://sites.psu.edu/siowfa14/2014/09/07/learning-a-second-language-is-easier-for-children-but-why/%0ahttps://www.canr.msu.edu/news/advantages_of_a_bilingual_brain%0ahttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/parenting/children-language-development.html%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-044029-63280#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Advantages of being a child %0a-> - williamh57%0a-> [-08.12.2022 - 20:40-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-044029-63280 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI have wondered and researched about this topic too in the past.

As stated above, plasticity is crucial to the language learning process and that's no different for any other skill, whether that be learning to play an instrument or improving at a new sport; the new connections that form as a result of said plasticity allows more flexibility and understanding. Additionally, compared to adults, children also have no fear of failure, don't overthink, as well as overall just being playful (all of which inhibit learning in functioning adults).%0a%0aOverall, children win GG claps EZ. Now what can we take from this. If we want to learn something, pretend to be a child again OR we can actively make a stride to avoid overthinking, stress, et cetera.
