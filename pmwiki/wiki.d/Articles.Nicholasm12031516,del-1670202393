This is done in a particular way through music and poetic verse, especially in folk traditions. Folk music brings together the storytelling of all language use, the emotive techniques of poetry, and “a repository of national culture” (Yarmakeev, 235). Thus, folk music can be used for unique pedagogical purposes—both for first and foreign language studies. For foreign language studies, folk music gives students access to recognizable and familiar emotive and social descriptors in their new language. A study introducing Russian children to English-language folk music found significant improvements in language acquisition and use over their control group class without the use of music, with an especially notable difference in the use of idioms (Yarmakeev, 239). In first language studies, the stories and repetitive nature of songs can encourage deeper engagement with their own language and culture. A potential concern in using folk music for teaching is the presence of “unusual sentence patterns,” but children actually strengthen their language comprehension by engaging with use patterns different from their own. The method of comparison between the content in folk songs and students’ own lives also allows for a teaching of cultural history that, in regular classroom contexts, can be considered difficult or boring by the same students (Martin, 327-328).%0a%0aYarmakeev, Iskander E., et al. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311605672_Folk_songs_do_magic_in_teaching_speech_and_grammar_patterns_in_EFL_class.%0a%0aMartin, Rita J. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41961304. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Folk Pedagogy:)
