It seems like a word that I've heard over and over again; after all, it is quite a fun way to convey the feeling of being confused and puzzled. Yet after a quick search, I found that "confuzzled" was, in fact, not in the OED. Using Stamper's criteria, I believe it is very likely that "confuzzled" will soon enter the OED.%0a%0aTo start, “confuzzled” has one simple meaning: being confused and puzzled. This meaning has not seemed to change since the earliest entries found in Urban Dictionary. Through Urban Dictionary, I found many entries describing its meaning from 2003 until present day, showing its widespread and sustained use. In addition, “confuzzled” has its own Wiktionary page with numerous citations from as early as 1993. Merriam-Webster has already declared “confuzzled” a word to watch, pending more widespread use. Thus, as a word with a well-established meaning and widespread and sustained use, “confuzzled” definitely seems like a word that soon will enter the OED.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 220909-232620-918880#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Supporting "confuzzled" to get into the OED %0a-> - xiqiaog%0a-> [-09.09.2022 - 16:26-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 220909-232620-918880 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI want to upvote this article about why "confuzzled" should be added to the OED. First, as said in the article, "confuzzled" has its spot in Urban Dictionary (1) and Wikipedia (2). It's also a natural combination of the words "confused" and "puzzled" to express the mixture of their meanings. Based on the episode, this makes "confuzzled" easier to be added to OED because it's based on existing, widely-used words, and straightforward to understand. It's similar to "niggling" that's discussed in the episode. Also, I think adding "confuzzled" help people express their feelings because at least for me, the difference between "confused" and "puzzled" is more subtle than obvious. And so I would love a combination of them to just tell people I need more explanation on something.%0a(1)https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=confuzzled %0a(2)https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/confuzzled%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 220909-232620-918880#%0a#foxbegin 220910-204027-422350#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Agree with Confuzzled in OED %0a-> - aarnavp%0a-> [-10.09.2022 - 13:40-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 220910-204027-422350 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a%0aI also agree that confuzzle should be added into the OED, as it adequately meets the standards listed in the podcast with widespread usage, sustained use, and clear definition. The topic of portmanteaux/blends were discussed in the podcast as easier to be added into the dictionary, as there are already examples of them there (such as “Brexit”). Portmanteaux are also commonly used in regards to technology, with much computer terminology deriving from the blending of various terms – e.g bit from binary and digit. (1) Portmanteaux can also lead to generation of new words as a stem word, which can be seen with confuzzle – confuzzler is defined as someone who “confuzzles” you (2). This idea that a word can serve as a root to the creation of new words should further bolster the argument of why it should be added into the OED, as it speaks to the clarity of its definition, as well as its sustained usage. %0a%0a1)https://blog.wordnik.com/unmapped-words-portmanteaus%0a2) https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Confuzzler%0a3)https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-38326516%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 220910-204027-422350#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: FunWithWords:)%0a(:Title: Confuzzled:)
