Although the ability to perceive tones is universally present in infants, this ability deteriorates rapidly. In a study on the perception of tones by infants learning a non-tone language, Liu and Kager found that infants are able to discriminate tonal contrasts at 5–6 months, but their tonal sensitivity deteriorates at around 9 months, after which time a salient contrast may remain discriminable throughout infancy, whereas a less salient one does not. Southern Min usually has five to seven tones depending on the region, but all of the tones don’t have register differences, making them harder to distinguish than those in Mandarin. So, if we don’t have early exposure to the language, it might be difficult to learn to distinguish them as non-native speakers. Personally, I’m a native speaker of Mandarin, but I can’t really distinguish the tones in Min either.%0a%0aThe second reason might be that Southern Min has tone sandhi, which refers to the change in tones under the influence of adjacent words. The same Chinese character usually has different tones when it is pronounced in isolation, in words, and when it is put into a longer sentence. Tone sandhi is an important feature in Southern Min that’s not present in Mandarin. The rules for tone sandhi are EXTREMELY complicated and is almost impossible to be mastered by non-native speakers. (if you are interested, the second link below is a 200-page dissertation describing the tone sandhi in Southern Min in detail). Just knowing the tones for each Chinese character isn’t enough because you still have to learn how the tones change when they are combined with other words with different tones. That probably explains why the tones in Southern Min can be very challenging to learn. Hope you find this helpful.%0a%0aCitation %0aLiu, Liquan, and René Kager.
