The term ‘vowel inventory’ thus refers to the group of vowel contrasts that a language incorporates. The ‘vowel inventories’ category is comprised of three different values: ‘small vowel inventory’, which indicates a language with only 2-4 vowel contrasts; ‘average vowel inventory’, which indicates a language with 5-6 vowel contrasts; and ‘large vowel inventory’, which indicates a language with 7-14 vowel contrasts.%0a%0aEnglish falls into the ‘large vowel inventory’ category with around 15 different vowel contrasts, while Garrwa falls into the ’small vowel inventory’ category with only around 3 vowel contrasts. Vowels in Garrwa only contrast at the front, central, and back points of articulation. Moreover, as opposed to the relatively larger number of vowels within English, Garrwa has only 3: [i], [u], and [a]. E.g: [mili] means “more”, [mali] means “flood waters”, and [mulu] means “nose”,%0a%0aI think it’s fascinating that many Aboriginal Australian languages have very few vowel contrasts (and very few vowel sounds in general). It would be interesting to further investigate what sort of factors (geographical or cultural) may have resulted in this.%0a%0aSource: http://sealang.net/archives/pl/pdf/PL-A37.1.pdf%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
