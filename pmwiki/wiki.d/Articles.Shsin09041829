The word "allosexual" should be added to the OED because it meets all three of these criteria. %0a%0aThe third criterion is met as "allosexual" has a defined meaning, as can be seen in Urban Dictionary. According to user LittleMissAce, "Allosexual is a term used most commonly in the asexual community to refer to someone who is not asexual.%0aSomeone who is allosexual is someone who experiences sexual attraction (6)". %0a%0aThe word "allosexual" meets the first criterion for addition to the dictionary because it has been in use for at least a decade. One early conversation surrounding the word "allosexual" took place in 2012 on the blog The Asexual Agenda. A post was written by a user named Siggy to describe and promote the use of the word. They wrote, "'Sexual', as a term for people off the ace-spectrum, is a bad term.  Most words have problems, but I think 'sexual' has problems that should kill it.  I prefer 'allosexual' as an alternative. (2)" Comments and threads on the discussion forum of the Asexual Visibility and Education Network also included the use of the term "allosexual" in the early 2010s, demonstrating that this word has been understood in parts of the online asexual community for close to a decade (3)(4)(5). The criterion of sustained use is met because the word "allosexual" is still in use in September 2022 in popular magazines such as Cosmopolitan (7).%0a%0a"Allosexual" also meets the second criterion of widespread use because its use is not limited to a particular community. According to Google Trends, Google users all over the world have searched for the word "allosexual" from the Americas, Oceania, Europe, Asia, and Africa (8). This demonstrates that the term "allosexual" has widespread use, meaning that it meets all the criteria required to be added to the dictionary. This is especially important because there are currently no other words in the dictionary that serve as an antonym to the word "asexual" as it refers to human sexuality (9)%0a%0aSources:%0a(1) https://open.spotify.com/episode/0X93S8yVIi7Udo7FktdKoP?si=QzWeEj5cTcOZ1_RQgNYD5w%0a(2) https://web.archive.org/web/20210922043155/https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/why-i-use-allosexual/%0a(3) https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/48196-anyone-past-50-on-here/page/58/?tab=comments#comment-2302792%0a(4) https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/13175-the-asexual-sexual-qa-thread/page/17/?tab=comments#comment-2469302%0a(5) https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/80998-i-dont-want-sex-and-thats-okay-how-it-feels-to-hear-about-asexuality/page/11/?tab=comments#comment-2471621%0a(6) https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Allosexual%0a(7) https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a41058910/what-is-asexual-spectrum/%0a(8) https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%25205-y&q=allosexual%0a(9) https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asexual#English%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 220912-035933-691560#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!The path to normalization  %0a-> - dani26%0a-> [-11.09.2022 - 20:59-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 220912-035933-691560 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAs is pointed out in a healthline article (1), asexuality is often seen as deviation from the norm or what is "normal", when it (~1%25) is statistically just as represented as those who identify as gay/lesbian (1.6%25) and bisexual (0.7%25) in the United States (figures from CDC survey included in the %0a (2) USNews article).
