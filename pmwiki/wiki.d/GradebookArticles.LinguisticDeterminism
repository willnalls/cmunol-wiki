To reiterate some basic definitions, linguistic relativity is the idea that the language people speak/use has some notable influence on their patterns of thought. On the other hand, linguistic determinism goes much further in the same vein to postulate the specific language people use can determine the very way they structure their thoughts.%0a%0aWhile few linguists or people in general argue against linguistic relativity, due in part to a large amount of supporting evidence, determinism is a far more extreme and controversial view. Thus it will be interesting to explore some argument for and against determinism.%0a%0aA famed hypothesis for linguistic determinism is the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, written in the early 20th century. Whorf writes "We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language".%0a%0aThe numerous studies that promote linguistic relativity give some headway to the theory of determinism. Furthermore, the way people categorize the world is understandably an important thought-structuring mechanic. For example, aboriginal language speakers show much more awareness of cardinal positioning than speakers of languages that do not emphasize cardinal position.%0a%0aStanding against determinism is the relatively moderate amount of similarity between the thought patterns of people that speak the same language. Studies in general do not indicate language being a notably primary factor in people's thought patterns. Furthermore, it is commonly seen that learning new languages does not require upheaval of thought structure and students retain largely the same thinking style after great acquisition.%0a%0aToday, most linguists do not ascribe to linguistic determinism for the above reason. Yet, the notion is still of interest as there remain studies, such as the aboriginal language and direction study mentioned above, to measure the extent language can influence thought.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/language-and-thought%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
