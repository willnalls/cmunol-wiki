The topic there I know most about is the various types of aphasia. %0a%0aBroca's aphasia is where Broca's area is damaged. Broca's area has to do with language generation, so Broca's aphasiacs can listen to and understand speech, but they cannot easily speak themselves. Since they know words and can understand what comes out of their own mouths, they can make short combinations of words with much effort.%0a%0aWernicke's aphasia is where Wernicke's area is damaged. Wernicke's area has to do with language understanding, so Wernicke's aphasiacs cannot understand language easily, but they make syntactically correct sentences that often do not have much meaning. Since they do not get live feedback on their own speech, they may use words semantically incorrectly or make up their own words.%0a%0aI don't know what book it was that I read - was it The Language Instinct? - but I read about where certain cases of brain damage make certain results. One case is where the victim had the connection between the Broca's and Wernicke's areas damaged, and could therefore neither understand nor produce speech. Another was where Broca's and Wernicke's areas were connected but isolated from the rest of the brain, where the victim parroted whatever she was told.
