I think this happens because the high school I went to was in Beijing, but the language of instruction was English. As a result, at most all the students there is English/Mandarin bilingual. Between students, we would speak a mixture of both languages, even mid-sentence. We would often say a sentence that is majorly one language, but with some parts(nouns/verb) replaced by vocabulary from the other language. I'm curious if this happens in other languages too. Or does it only happen if the group of people went through the early stages of language learning together?%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----
