For them, there are only two types of things: those that fit a category, and those who do not. For example, the "Bar" is used to describe the test people have to pass in order to become a lawyer. "Bar" only describes a standard for which people are considered to pass, or not pass, and doesn't take into account if a person did particularly well, very poorly, or very close to the cutoff score. Similarly, the phrase "bar a few" means "except", dividing people into a group that fits a category and another group that does not. The phrase doesn't account for having a gray zone at all. Moreover, even "bars" people drink from can be thought of as a divide because people are either behind the bar or in front of the bar.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
