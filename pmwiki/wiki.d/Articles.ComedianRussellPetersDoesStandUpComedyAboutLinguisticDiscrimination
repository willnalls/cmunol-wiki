The Simpsons is a popular example of this where the character Apu speaks with a flat sing song Indian accent. An Indian American comedian actually released a documentary called “The Problem With Apu” which details the problems with the racial stereotypes propagated by this portrayal. I was especially surprised that a white man had been voicing the character rather than an Indian man as one would expect. Also, it’s interesting that there is only one caricature of an Indian accent in American and British media when there are actually numerous true versions of the accent. Given that there are so many different languages spoken in India, it makes sense that all these Indian speakers would have different accents when speaking English. However, instead of recognizing this fact, TV usually groups all Indians into one category by using the same accent for every Indian character.%0a%0ahttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailyo.in/lite/arts/the-simpsons-big-bang-theory-goodness-gracious-me-stereotyping-indians-dont-understand-theres-no-indian-english-accent/story/1/25744.html%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210424-155608-960570#%0a#foxbegin 210430-225518-323570#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Another example of Indian accents in media %0a-> - sanjana_m%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAn example of the Indian accent being used for comedic purposes starts all the way at a show meant for young children -- Phineas and Ferb.
