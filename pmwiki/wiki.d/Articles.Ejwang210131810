Historically, its origin is surprisingly uncertain even today. During the Russian-Japanese war and later due to Japanese governmental policies, Ainu speakers were displaced and persecuted—severely limiting how much knowledge of the language was passed from generation to generation. Starting around the mid 20th century, however, the formation of Hokkaido’s Ainu association—made possible by funding allocated through targeted language preservation laws—began to somewhat address these concerns. However, the scope and ultimate impact of these programs is unknown and likely small, which is part of the reason why Ainu is classified as a nearly extinct (8b) language under the EGIDS scale. Perhaps most crucially, however, is that current interest in learning the Ainu language among the Ainu population is mostly confined to those who possess the time and resources to do so. For this reason, many Ainu today face structural barriers to learning and thus aiding the recovery of their language.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221023-014240-152140#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Further Discussion of the Ainu Language %0a-> - mswendse%0a-> [-22.10.2022 - 18:42-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221023-014240-152140 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe Ainu language is very much the minority in modern day Japan, as it is mostly an isolated language with no known language family and is mostly spoken rather than written. However, when written, the Ainu language borrows the katakana writing system of the modern Japanese language since it lacks its own. The Ainu lexicon reflects the culture’s hunter/gatherer history, as many words refer to sea life such as whales and seals (1). Because of its lack of writing system, the Ainu culture instead was mainly endowed in oral storytelling. Called “yukar” in the Ainu language, these are ancient epics and stories about gods that were passed down orally through the Ainu language (2). There are theories that the Ainu language and Japanese are more closely related than previously thought, as there are some similarities in the two languages’ grammar systems such as sentence structure being subject - object - verb for both (3). In addition, videos on YouTube and other platforms exist to help preserve the Ainu language. The channel, しとちゃんねる, has around 64 videos that are focused on content preserving and giving lessons on the Ainu language.
