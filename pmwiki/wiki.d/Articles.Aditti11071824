It is categorized as a critically endangered language by UNESCO with less than 1600 speakers as per the 2001 consensus, most speakers being grandparents or older who use the language infrequently. The Toda are a small pastoral tribal community whose economy runs primarily on trading dairy products with neighboring tribes. %0aToda is characterized by its many fricatives and trills, with 16 vowels (8 vowel qualities which may occur long or short), and consonants which occur in 7 places of articulation, including a retroflex lateral. The language is written in a version of Tamil, and is considered to be typologically aberrant and phonologically difficult. After the 1971 Census, the Indian government had stated that any indigenous language, that is spoken by less than 10,000 people, would no longer be considered in the list of official languages of India. This ruling has been a major contributing factor to the decline of the language. %0aEfforts are now being made to revitalize the language. Presently, an attempt is made to document Toda grammar, the Toda English-Tamil dictionary, basic core vocabulary and an Ethnolinguistics profile. When a language dies, the knowledge system around it also dies and becomes extinct, and through it a unique way of looking at the world is lost. As a country where cultural shifts and dialect changes take place every 11 kilometers, India is home to thousands of languages. However, the loss of languages and dialects has been a major loss for cultural heritage all across India. %0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/15/language-extinct-endangered %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toda_language#cite_note-e18-1 %0ahttps://www.sppel.org/todadoc.aspx %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221112-220457-424010#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Toda speakers %0a-> - ejwang2%0a-> [-12.11.2022 - 14:04-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221112-220457-424010 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThis is a video in which Toda speakers talk about their culture. %0a%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENI1Dl5FQzM%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221112-220457-424010#%0a#foxbegin 221209-094301-750#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Toda words as compared to Tamil %0a-> - haridesikan%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 01:43-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-094301-750 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aBeing located in Tamil Nadu, where the majority of speakers speak Tamil, Today is notably quite distinct from Tamil (more distinct than Malayalam, a closely related language.)
