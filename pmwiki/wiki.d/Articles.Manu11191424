In school, I was given some education on the history of Indigenous people in the area, but it mostly lacked specific information as well as any information about the more recent history of the descendents of Indigenous people.One group of people who were indigenous to this area was the Wampanoag tribe. An IPA transcription of the original pronunciation is: ‘wɒːmpənɔg’. %0a%0aThe Pilgrim-Wampanoag Peace Treaty of 1621 was signed by the Plymouth governor John Carter and the Wampanoag chief Massasoit. It pronounced peace between the two groups, and was honored until the conflict known as King Philip's War. It is the “only treaty signed between English colonists and Native Americans to have been honored, without modification, throughout the lives of its signatories”.%0a%0aThe language of the Wompanoag, also known as Massachusett or Pokanoket, was banned by British colonizers, who eventually became Americans, in the 1600s. The language fell out of use, and it is thought that by the late 1900s all fluent speakers of the language had died. However, there has been a recent effort to revitalize both the language and culture of the Wampanoag people, including the Wampanoag Language Reclamation Project. This project includes classes and immersion in a school, as well as community classes and programs. The language is still not used commonly, as there are only a couple dozen fluent speakers in Massachusetts today, and the total number of speakers (of varying degrees of fluency), is in the hundreds.%0a%0aSome of the most glaring differences I noticed between the Indigenous-created sources and other sites such as Wikipedia and History.com was the emphasis, or lack thereof, on values and cultural history. Indigenous sites were very focused on how the language has been used in the past(for example, a bible which was translated to Wampanoag in 1631), and how it is being used today. Some sources look at reclamation efforts and describe the way the language is still being kept alive today. The non-Indigenous sources, in contrast, focus much more on the characteristics of the language in comparison to other languages, such as the alphabet, lexicon, and the groups it was spoken by and their geographic locations. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttp://massachusetttribe.org/life-of-the-indigenous-massachusett-at-ponkapoag-plantation%0ahttps://www.mcnaa.org/%0ahttps://www.mattakeeset.com/history%0ahttps://mashpeewampanoagtribe-nsn.gov/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wampanoag%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusett_language%0ahttps://www.history.com/news/wampanoag-pilgrim-peace-treaty-thanksgiving%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221122-162144-879730#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Expansion on Wampanoag Tribe and Language %0a-> - justinzo%0a-> [-22.11.2022 - 08:21-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221122-162144-879730 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe name Wampanoag is most likely derived from Wapanoos which was the earliest European representation of the Wampanoag territory.(1) They were very similar to many other indigenious tribes with roles being divided based on gender roles.
