I understand uncommon consonants as consonant features that are unique to just a couple languages across the world. This can include anything like clicks, pharyngeals, labial-velars, the “th” sound, and even rarer are different combinations of these within the same language. These features may be uncommon for different reasons including geographical context, genetics, or even that these certain consonants require more muscular force.%0a %0aFor this article, I have chosen to examine the contrasts between Zulu (a South African language) and English in terms of their respective uncommon consonants. For instance, English has the uncommon “th” sound, otherwise known as the dental fricative. This dental fricative category includes both the unvoiced [θ] and the voiced [ð], and is present in only around 43 languages. The Zulu people don’t have dental fricatives, but they frequently use clicks in their language. Zulu contains 4 different clicks: the bilabial P click [ʘ], the dental C click [ǀ], the palatoalveolar X click [ǂ], and the postalveolar [ǃ] Q click. Clicking is only present in around 9 languages in the world! More information and pronunciation can be found in this native speaker’s video:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHHGOYu6Fl0%0a %0aClicks are produced by a sucking action of the tongue, or in technical terms, with a lingual ingressive airstream mechanism. Zulu clicking produces some of the loudest consonants in any language, while languages like Sandawe and Hazda have more subtle clicking, often mistaken for ejectives. In contrast, the English dental fricative is produced by the tip of the tongue being placed behind the top front teeth, paired with passage of air either with the vocal folds vibrating (producing [ð]), or resting (producing [θ]).%0a %0aI found it interesting that some linguists think that the reason clicking is so uncommon is because it requires more muscular force than other consonants (some clicks require suction of the tongue). They also found that it is also more common in people with smaller alveolar ridges. These findings left me wondering; can infants just as easily acquire clicking as they can the English dental fricative, or is it more difficult because they don’t have the developed muscular structures? %0a %0aSources:%0ahttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-click-speech-is-rare/#:~:text=Click%2520sounds%252C%2520such%2520as%2520those,Africa%252C%2520make%2520perfectly%2520good%2520consonants.&text=These%2520allowed%2520less%2520air%2520to,an%2520anatomical%2520bias%2520against%2520clicks.%0a %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant#:~:text=Anatomically%252C%2520clicks%2520are%2520obstruents%2520articulated,a%2520lingual%2520ingressive%2520airstream%2520mechanism%0a %0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHHGOYu6Fl0%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
