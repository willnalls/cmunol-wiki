We have learned about voiced and unvoiced consonants as the two primary glottal fold configurations. There are other less common configurations known as glottalized consonants, which involves 3 separate categories:%0a%0aEjective Stops, which involve the upward movement of the larynx with the closing of the glottal folds, creating a quick plosive noise. Written such as [p'] for the bilabial ejective stop.%0a%0aImplosives, which involve the downward movement of the larynx, creating inwards airflow to the mouth, creating a noise that ends sharper. Written such as [ɠ] for the voiced velar implosive.%0a%0aGlottalized Resonants, which involve free air flow with a slightly tighter constriction of the glottal folds than non-glottalized. Written such as [m'] for the glottalized bilabial nasal.%0a%0aEnglish does not make any distinction with glottalized consonants, however, Hausa, a language found primarily in Nigeria and the Sahel, makes use of both ejective stops and implosives, but not resonants. %0a%0aIt is fairly uncommon for a language to use ejective and implosives together as Hausa does (resonants are even more uncommon). This is interesting because one would think that having some glottalized constants would make it more likely to see other glottalized consonants from increased muscle control. Do all three of these consonant types develop independently, or together?%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
