Many of these consonants are either pharyngealized or are articulated in the pharynx. Research has shown that these pharyngeal or pharyngealized consonants (ħ, dˤ, tˤ, sˤ, ðˤ) are particularly difficult for English-speakers to produce. In fact, research has also shown that English speakers also have trouble even distinguishing some of these sounds from one another. For instance, one study found that English-speakers rated d-dˤ, ð-ðˤ, t-tˤ, k-q, and s-sˤ to be the most difficult consonant contrasts to perceieve (Shehata, 2015). It is interesting that most of these contrasts are between a consonant that exists in English and its pharyngealized version. It makes sense that pharyngealization is difficult for English-speakers to perceive, as there are no pharyngealized consonants in English. Since these differences between consonants that exist in English and their pharyngealized counterparts are nearly imperceptible for English speakers, I would imagine that English speakers often do the non-pharyngealized consonant when they should be doing the pharyngealized version when learning Arabic.%0aSource: Shehata, A.
