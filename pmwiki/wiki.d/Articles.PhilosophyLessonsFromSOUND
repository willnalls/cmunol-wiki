When hearing a debate, one opponent's argument can be SOUND. I can SOUNDly agree with someone and their opinion, but also say some plans with friends SOUND good. Someone who just got a job and is back on their feet financially is SOUND too. Someone can be of SOUND-mind if they are deemed mentally stable. You can SOUND the depth of water to determine the bottom, but also feel relieved when a friend in trouble returns safe and SOUND. You can also SOUND the alarms in the face of danger. But when we sleep, we even can sleep SOUNDly. One can d.j. in a SOUND studio as well. We can even to our friends that their day SOUNDed hard after they fail a test.

Again and again, sound is used to express an urge for the stability of the mind, of satefy, of argument, of sleep, and more. Likely, these people have undergone great terrors, possibly haunted by their past or currently under heavy social upheaval. Nothing is consistent, nothing is stable, and thus nothing is sound. The incredible and vast use of sound proves their wish for a stable society and a consistent, happy life. Furthermore, sound can be related to this wish for safety by its use for explaining noise and warnings. This negative side to sound likely reflects this need for warning danger present in their current society. Constant noise and destruction led to the use of having to 'sound' the alarms or even categorize this constant noise as sound. Overall, the Nacirema people are devastated people, desperately clinging to the long-lost idea of stability and facing their destruction-filled reality through the use of sound. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)
