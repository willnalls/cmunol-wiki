The reason I chose the tribe was because when I am not at CMU, I reside on Long Island in the town of North Hempstead. Because of their location, they were some of the first people to experience the effects of settlement by the Europeans in the seventeenth century. Their land was forcibly seized by European settlers, specifically the Dutch, and many were killed or forced to move eastwards. The IPA transcription of how to pronounce the tribe’s name is mətɪnəkɑk.%0a%0aThey are an algonquian tribe and speak the language of Munsee, which is part of the Eastern Algonquian language family. The language was originally spoken around the southern areas of the Hudson River valley, the northern areas of the Delaware River valley, and in eastern Long Island. Currently, the language is critically endangered. Currently, there are only 2 native speakers of the language left. As such, the language is only looked at today from an education perspective. There does exist, however, efforts to maintain the language. Websites exist online that contain vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and more about the language. I could not find an estimate of how many non-native speakers there were or how many people were studying the language, just the 2 native speakers.%0a%0aAfter researching, a key difference between Native American run sources and non-Native American run sources (specifically Wikipedia), is that the native sources tend to promote the language as one that is still alive and being studied, whereas Wikipedia promotes the language as one that will be extinct soon, and omits information on the conservation of the language. They both, however, briefly go over the mechanics of the language, such as phonology and grammar.%0a%0ahttp://www.matinecocktribalnation.org/ %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoac %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsee_language %0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/munsee.htm %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: C:)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)%0a(:Title: The Matinecock Tribe:)
