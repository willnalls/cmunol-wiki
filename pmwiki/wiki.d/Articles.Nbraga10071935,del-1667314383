I chose this tribe because a big part of it is located in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is the city I was born in and spent most of my childhood in. %0aDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spaniards and the Portuguese arrived in the Americas in the hopes of conquering land. Which is when the territory previously inhabited by the Guarani became the stage for the dispute between them. In the following centuries because the Guarani and other surrounding tribes did not submit to Spanish and Portuguese rule, they had to flee their own territories. %0aThe Guarani is a family of different tribes that spread throughout the same region. The specific tribe I am researching is called Guarani Mbya, where the language spoken is called Mbya. Mbya is a dialect of the Guarani language, which belongs to the Tupi-Guarani family, which belongs to the Tupi language trunk.%0aIPA Transcription: Guarani- ˌɡwɑːrəˈniː%0aAlthough the Indigenous site does not have any mention of this, it is known that there was a war between the Guarani Tribe and the Spaniards in 1756, which was a result of the Treaty of Madrid. It was later dissolved. In regard to the regularization of the areas occupied by Mbya Guarani, we know that the process only started in 1979 when projects and initiatives were undertaken by CTI (Center of Service for Indigenous people). Now the tribe is protected by the government and has villages in multiple states in Brazil.%0aThe Mbya Guarani try to keep their language alive and in full use by using oral transmission as their main system of education. They use that to spread knowledge to the children in their village and make sure that language is still a strong element of their identity. They also started an initiative for writing in the Guarani language due to the implementation of bilingual schools in 1997. Although it is unclear the number of active speakers, we know that the Guarani population in Brazil in 2008 was estimated around 51,000 where 7,000 people were part of the Mbya tribe.%0aAfter searching a non-Indigenous site, I realized how focused it is on the history as seen by the colonizers. The history of the tribe is much more focused on how they were colonized by the Spaniards and the Portuguese rather than how they originated and about their culture. When looking at how language is described in both sites, I feel as though there is not as much of a difference. Both websites mention how much language is important for the identity of the tribe and how is passed mainly through oral transmission. However, I feel like when I looked at Wikipedia it was much more technological, it described the language in terms of phonetics, morphology, and syntax and vocabulary. When in comparison the Indigenous website never mentioned anything regarding that.%0ahttps://native-land.ca/%0ahttps://native-land.ca/maps/territories/mbya/%0ahttps://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Guarani_Mbya#Population%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mby%25C3%25A1_Guaran%25C3%25AD_people%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 221008-024313-640000#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-07.10.2022 - 19:43-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 221008-024313-640000 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!nbraga%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aDisregard this article, I posted it in the wrong category. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221008-024313-640000#%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Guarani Mbya:)
