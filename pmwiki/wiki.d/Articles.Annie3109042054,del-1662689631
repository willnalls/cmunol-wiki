In this essay, lexicographer Kory Stamper’s three-criteria methodology – having a meaning, sustained use, and widespread use – will be employed to discuss whether “deadliner” should get into the dictionary. %0a> Considering the first criterion, “deadliner,” according to Urban Dictionary, refers to “one who procrastinates until the actual deadline of a task or project.” [1] It was first used in Andrei Codrescu’s fiction “Zombification: Stories from National Public Radio” in 1995 – “I was ahead of my deadline so I watched ‘Flatliners,’ about some serious deadliners (...)” [2] – where Andrei simply added the suffix “-er” to “deadline” and created the fairly understandable term. As how Urban Dictionary defines the term, “deadliner” has a much more frequently used substitute “procrastinator,” borrowed from Latin in the 1600s. [3]%0a> While Andrei probably just created “deadliner” to echo “deadline” in the same sentence of the fiction, “deadliner” gradually owns quite a few users in countries that do not speak English as a primary language, especially Chinese high school students. Derived from “deadline,” a visualized and memorable word itself formed by putting “dead” and “line” together, “deadliner” is more friendly to second language speakers than the brand-new word “procrastinator.” As long as those speakers exist and teachers keep pushing them with heavy workloads, “deadliner” does have sustainable use.%0a> However, when searching the two words on English academic websites and social media platforms, the results reveal that “deadliner” is completely unqualified for widespread use. For instance, ERIC Institute of Education Sciences gives no results for “deadliner” and 56 results for “procrastinator,” [4] while on Instagram, the “deadliner” tag only has 1,019 posts, compared to the “procrastinator” tag with 175,279 posts.%0a> Thus, referring to Kory Stamper’s three-criteria methodology, the answer to whether “deadliner” should be added to the OED is unfortunately no.
