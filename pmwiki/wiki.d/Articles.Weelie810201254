Seediq consist of three main dialects: Truku, Toda, and Tgdaya. Truku has 20,000 members including non-speakers. Toda consists of 2,500 member including non-speakers. Tgdaya consists of 2,500 member including non-speakers. The total number of native speakers are too small compare with the number of other languages, which is one of the main reasons why Seediq language is considered as endangered. Besides, Seediq is very hard to learn for non-native speakers. It only has 19 consonants and 4 vowels. Among the sounds, the alveolar affricate has a marginal phonological status and is found in some interjections (such as teʼcu! "what a mess!"), loanwords and non-finite verbal forms with the gerund prefix case. Seediq’s EGIDS level is considered as 6b* level, which indicates that it is most likely to be losing speakers. In order to preserve the language or revitalize Seediq, people should encourage others to learn the language because of the lack of native speakers. %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seediq_language%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/language/trv%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Seediq:)%0a(:if [ authgroup @tas || authgroup @admins || equal {$Author} '' ]:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=edit|Edit this page]] \\%0aStatus: {GradebookArticles.{$Name}$:Status} %0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!{$:Category}]]%0a%0a!Seediq%0a%0a:Author: weelie8%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aThe information about Seediq%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aSeediq, also known as Sediq, Taroko, is an Atayalic language spoken in the mountains of Northern Taiwan by the Seediq and Taroko People.
