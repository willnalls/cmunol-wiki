Everyone my mom's generation or older can speak at least both English and Tagalog. My mom is a little different. She can understand Tagalog perfectly. In fact, she does not even realize when someone is speaking Tagalog to her compared to English until she turns to me, my siblings, or my dad to ask us our thoughts on something my grandmother said in Tagalog. But, she cannot speak Tagalog. Some in my immediate family think that since she understands another language without really thinking, she is bilingual. The other side of the debate is that since the communication is only in Tagalog one way, she isn't.%0a%0aTo add more confusion is the fact that, since Tagalog has so many similarities to Spanish, my mom can also understand Spanish and can speak it almost fluently, but not unprompted. If she is in an environment with Spanish speakers, hearing Spanish, she can easily communicate in Spanish. Outside of that environment, not so much. So its a similar situation of knowing a language, but not quite fully.
