While the occurrences shown above are taught in a formal setting, native speakers of Tagalog/Filipino naturally assimilate nasal consonants when speaking quickly. For example: Ang tagal mo!

This works for many other phrases, like "ang dilim" => "andilim" which is "it's so dark" and even in swear words (which I will not list here).%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)
