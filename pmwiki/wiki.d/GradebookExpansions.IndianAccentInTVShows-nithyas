You mention that typically, the [d] and [t] sounds in Indian dialects of English involve pronouncing the consonant further back in the sound, and this is largely due to the fact that the [d] and [t] sounds in Indian languages are typically pronounced further back in the mouth. I think this is certainly true, and can think of numerous examples ("dabba" - box, "kadavul" - god, etc.), but I'm not sure if the claim that alveolar and dental plosives cease to exist altogether is true. The reason for this is there are many words I can think of where my natural pronunciation of the [d] or [t] sound in the word is in fact alveolar and not further back ("pattasu" - firework, "padam" - movie). However, I'm not entirely sure if this is a consequence of my own pronunciation, and it is worth noting that the pronunciations of the words I listed are not audibly altered if they are pronounced as retroflex rather than alveolar. Additionally, it is hard to verify by looking up transcriptions for these words since the scripts for these languages are different, so you may very well be correct, but it is definitely an interesting thing to think about.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
