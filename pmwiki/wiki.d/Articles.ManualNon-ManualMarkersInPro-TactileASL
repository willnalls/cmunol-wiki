These categories are each used to mark degree/manner, time, duration, frequency, purpose, and place/position/direction. For example, to illustrate speed or a small amount of time, the signing is sped up and possibly tension is increased in the signer's hand or wrist. %0a%0aAdditionally, in visual ASL, movements of the head indicate negation and question formation, but these cannot be observed by a deafblind person. In PASL, signs such as "NOT" and "NO" are used to indicate negation. Furthermore, PASL has signs for feelings and moods, such as "WOW", "IMPRESSED", "PUZZLED", and "QUESTION." These are all visually indicated in ASL through facial expressions and head movements, and these manual signs work to replace them. %0a%0aSource: %0ahttp://www.deafblind.com/card.html%0ahttps://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&context=honors_theses%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: D:)%0a(:Category: SignLanguage:)
