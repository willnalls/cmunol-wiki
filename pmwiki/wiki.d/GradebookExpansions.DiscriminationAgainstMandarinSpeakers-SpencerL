Even though I was exposed to both languages, I am only fluent in Mandarin and can only understand Cantonese to a certain extent. This is mainly due to the fact that my parents prioritized my education my Mandarin over Cantonese, due to the common usage of Mandarin in China. As I have seen from others of Chinese nationality, Cantonese is often noted by them to be loud and exaggerated. This brought me to question such logic, as I was curious how exactly this ideology was created. On main thing that I noticed (note that this may not be true as I am not a fluent Cantonese speaker) is that the extra two tones in Cantonese causes common day expressions to sound very exaggerated. To an extent, such extraneous tones may also have a correlation to being louder. In addition, I have also noticed many ideas that Cantonese is an ugly sounding language in comparison to Mandarin. I would like to note that these are just observations I have heard from others and I do not commit to these statements as facts.
