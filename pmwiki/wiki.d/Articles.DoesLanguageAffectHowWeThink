This conversation caught my attention, because I realized that I have a weird habit. When I am calculating math problems, I think in Mandarin. For example, when  I am calculating arithmetic problems in my head, the little voice in my head is "talking" in Mandarin. Strangely, I solve the problem faster when I am thinking about it in Mandarin. This is particularly weird to me, because I was born and educated in the United States. Consequentially, I should be thinking in English. This phenomenon made me consider the question about whether or not we think differently depending on which language we think with. In addition, does the history and growth of a certain language play a major role in how we think in that language?%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210208-014220-910390#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-07.02.2021 - 17:42-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210208-014220-910390 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!caseywalker%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aThought this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2sw-oRR2D8) video was interesting and kinda related.
