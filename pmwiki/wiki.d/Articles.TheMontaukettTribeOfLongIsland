The traditional stewards of the land are the Montaukett tribe. This tribe and many others on Long Island, including the Pequot, Narragansett, and Shinnecock, are often collectively referred to as “Mohegan,” but it should be noted that these tribes are all distinct. This combination of these tribes into one name is due to the population loss of each of these tribes during European settlement, which forced them to merge together and assimilate. While these tribes lost some of the unique aspects of their culture due to this assimilation, they still retain their own identity. The name Mohegan comes from the word Mahiingan, which means wolf, but due to European mispronunciation has become Mohegan. I did not see an IPA transcription of Montaukett, but the IPA transcription of the Anglicized version would be Mɑntɔkət. Given the information on the Mohegan language website, some possible native pronunciations would be Mantɔ̃kʌt or Mantʌkʌt (which I created by substituting sounds that exist in English but not Mohegan with similar sounds that are found in Mohegan). %0a%0aFrom what I gathered on the linked websites, there are no treaties that apply to this land because the land that the Montaukett occupied was technically “legally bought” by European settlers (largely through means of coercion and deception). What I found interesting, however, was that there is a New York Supreme Court ruling which prevents Montauketts from making claims on their land due to the fact that the Montauketts are “extinct.” The back story, however, is that after Montaukett land was unlawfully bought by European settlers, some Montauketts attempted to go through the courts to reclaim their land, but the defense used the argument that the Montauketts were actually extinct because there had been some intermarrying between the Montauketts and black people. They argued that this had “diluted their Indian blood” to the point that the land in question belonged to an extinct group. Due to the racial discrimination at the time which led people who had both African and Native American ancestry to be only labeled as African American, this argument was accepted by the Supreme Court of New York, and the Montauketts were denied the right to their land. This is still New York state law to this day, so even though Montaukett land was taken through unlawful means, the official history is that it was purchased.  %0a%0aThe Montauketts spoke the Mohegan language, which is one of the two Algonkian languages. It was spoken by several different tribes across New English, but has no native speakers today. However, there are active restoration efforts among the Mohegan and Pequot tribes to bring this language back into use.%0a%0aFrom reading the Wikipedia article, one thing that stuck out to me was the distinct difference in tone compared to the Matouwac Research Center article. The following sentence from the Matouwac Research article paints this idea well: “Tragically the Montaukett endured the confiscation of territory, the destruction of homes, judicial-instigated genocide, the dispersal of families – essentially the annihilation of a prehistoric culture just so this socialite Utopia, the luxurious retreat of millionaires and movie stars, can thrive.” Words like “tragically” and “annihilation” when contrasted with words like “luxurious” and “thrive” highlight the colossal injustice against the Montaukett tribe based on greed and entitlement of European settlers and developers. This bluntness is lost in the Wikipedia article, which glazes over the history of the dispersal and eradication of the Montaukett people, and also paints the actions of European settlers as either done by only a few bad apples or as detached from real people. For instance, in the sentence “They moved from Long Island to escape colonial encroachment” obscures the fact that these people were often forced off their land or coerced into selling it, and the sentence “This led racist individuals of that time to deny recognition to the Montaukett people” highlights that the Wikipedia author sees colonization motivated by a few bad people rather than something in which European American mentality was deeply rooted. In general, much of the emotional weight is lost in the Wikipedia article in its use of passive language and watered-down telling of historical events. %0a%0a%0ahttps://native-land.ca/maps/territories/montauk/%0ahttp://www.montaukwarrior.info/?page_id=274%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/mohegan.htm%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montaukett%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221700-517130#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221700-517130#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
