You can keep something put by HOLDING it in place. you can hug someone and HOLD them. If something is structurally sound or strong it can HOLD the weight of something. If you were to maintain a position or course you HOLD position/course. If you were detained you would be put under HOLD. If you were being sieged you could HOLD your territory. If you keep someone's attention to HOLD it. An argument HOLDS if it is sound. A container HOLDS an amount of something.

This can be seem and illustrated through their word 'Hold', which fundamentally means to keep in your grasp. While this is the primary meaning, 'Hold' is used in a wide variety of different ways throughout their language. If you want something to stay put, like a door, you would 'Hold' it in place. If you want to show affection and that you love someone you 'Hold' them by embracing them. If an argument is sound, or a something is structurally sound, you would say that it 'Holds'. If a criminal were arrested they would be put under 'Hold'. If a rival tribe were to attack but were repelled, it would be said that the defenders 'Held' their position and the Nacirema 'Hold' their territory, a particular defensive structure can also be known as a 'Hold'. From these examples alone you can see how pervasive the word 'Hold' is and how the Nacirema people see everything through the lens of material ownership, envisioning everything as grasping in their arms or hands. 'Hold' is synonymous with strength, as a strong structure or strong argument will 'hold' under weight or scrutiny. So pervasive is this idea, that it even transcends to the level of love and affection and war and conquest, where to show love you would 'hold' them and show that you envision them as in your possession in the same way you show you're military strength by the amount you can 'hold'. The unique way in which 'hold' exists in the Nacirema language show how the ideas of material possession is permeated as an idea throughout the whole culture through the structure of its language.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)
