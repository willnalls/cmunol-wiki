Even more interesting is that a common language has not seemingly emerged yet. I do not think one will, but I wonder what it would be like if a common, worldwide language formed.

There have been attempts to create a common language in the past. Most notably, Esperanto became really popular in the 1920s as it was considered to be an egalitarian language that's relatively easy to learn and as a result became really popular with various revolutionary groups. It eventually got repressed by fascist governments across Europe, but there are still some people who know Esperanto today. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210203-001359-490210#%0a%0a%0a%0a(:Section: :)%0a(:Category: PracticeCategory:)
