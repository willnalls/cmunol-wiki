The reason that people create languages is varied. Some languages were created to serve as an universal language. Others were created to facilitate scientific experiments or philosophical discussions. Creating languages can also help someone learn about linguistics. Finally, some people just find it to be a fun hobby.%0a%0aExamples:%0a%0aEsperanto:%0aEsperanto is, according to many, the most successful constructed language. Created in 1887 for the purpose of being used as a lingua franca, it is largely derived from other European languages. Some estimates place the number of Esperanto speakers at 100,000, and there are even some native speakers(3). It also has a course on Duolingo.%0a%0aKlingon:%0aKlingon is an artificial language spoken by the fictional alien race of the same name in Star Trek. It has been a commercial success, with a dictionary having sold 300,000 copies(2). It has a course on Duolingo, for some reason.%0a%0aIthkuil:%0aIthkuil is a constructed language made with the goal of allowing the speaker to communicate with extreme detail and with barely an ambiguity, while using as few  sounds as possible. To achieve this, it has 58 phonemes(English has 42), and the results are stunning. For example, "Aukkras  êqutta  ogvëuļa  tnou’elkwa  pal-lši  augwaikštülnàmbu" translates to "An imaginary representation of a nude woman in the midst of descending a staircase in a step-by-step series of tightly-integrated ambulatory bodily movements which combine into a three-dimensional wake behind her, forming a timeless, emergent whole to be considered intellectually, emotionally and aesthetically."(4) It should not be a surprise that Ithkuil was not created with the intention of actually being spoken.%0a%0aI dare the reader to get hired at Duolingo and make Ithkuil a course.%0a%0aToki Pona:%0aIn stark contrast to Ithkuil, Toki Pona is a language intended to be as simple as possible, and highly subject to interpretation. It has just 137 essential words(6), but still functions as a language. As such, it only takes about 30 hours to master(5).%0a%0a(1)https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/conlang-meaning-origin%0a(2)https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners%0a(3)https://www.britannica.com/topic/Esperanto%0a(4)http://ithkuil.net/texts.html%0a(5)https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-smallest-language-has-only-100-words-and-you-can-say-almost-anything-2015-7%0a(6)https://tokipona.org/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221205-185802-667780#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Constructed Languages in the work of J.R.R.

Tolkien. Tolkien was a British writer famous for The Lord of the Rings, a fantasy epic. Within his world several languages other than English are spoken and written. While many exist as shells of languages, some are fully realized constructed languages. Quenya, for example, is a language spoken by elves, which shares many traits with Finnish. Tolkien's addition to the world of constructed languages are difficult to overstate, as he was one of the first authors to invent a language solely for the purpose of his books. %0a%0aSource:%0ahttps://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Languages%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221205-185802-667780#%0a#foxbegin 221207-213025-893790#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Lojban, another constructed language %0a-> - cassidy%0a-> [-07.12.2022 - 13:30-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221207-213025-893790 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAnother successful conlang (constructed language) out there is Lojban, created by the Logical Language Group.

It's an interesting departure from English orthography, and some examples are below:%0a%0aFor example, the word "like" would use two symbols, one for "li" and one for "ke", where the symbol for "li" is the symbol for "i" attached to the right side of the symbol for "l", and the symbol for "ke" is constructed similarly.

Well most creative works don't need one, in most sci-fi or fantasy works one can get around this by simply stating that non-native languages simply seem like gibberish to the characters and later provide a method of instantaneous translation. One franchise where this method is most often seen is the DC universe which has an incredibly diverse cast spanning multiple galaxies and universes.

Well some people are just really dedicated. For example J.R.R. Tolkien actually created over 15 different languages and dialects spoken among different creatures and populations. This is certainly more a departure from the norm. We actually have started to see this constructed languages most commonly in TV series.

Tolkien. Tolkien was a British writer famous for The Lord of the Rings, a fantasy epic. Within his world several languages other than English are spoken and written. While many exist as shells of languages, some are fully realized constructed languages. Quenya, for example, is a language spoken by elves, which shares many traits with Finnish. Tolkien's addition to the world of constructed languages are difficult to overstate, as he was one of the first authors to invent a language solely for the purpose of his books. %0a%3c %0a%3c Source:%0a%3c https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Languages%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c #foxend 221205-185802-667780#%0a---%0a> %0a

The reason that people create languages is varied. Some languages were created to serve as an universal language. Others were created to facilitate scientific experiments or philosophical discussions. Creating languages can also help someone learn about linguistics. Finally, some people just find it to be a fun hobby.%0a%3c %0a%3c Examples:%0a%3c %0a%3c Esperanto:%0a%3c Esperanto is, according to many, the most successful constructed language. Created in 1887 for the purpose of being used as a lingua franca, it is largely derived from other European languages. Some estimates place the number of Esperanto speakers at 100,000, and there are even some native speakers(3). It also has a course on Duolingo.%0a%3c %0a%3c Klingon:%0a%3c Klingon is an artificial language spoken by the fictional alien race of the same name in Star Trek. It has been a commercial success, with a dictionary having sold 300,000 copies(2). It has a course on Duolingo, for some reason.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ithkuil:%0a%3c Ithkuil is a constructed language made with the goal of allowing the speaker to communicate with extreme detail and with barely an ambiguity, while using as few  sounds as possible. To achieve this, it has 58 phonemes(English has 42), and the results are stunning. For example, "Aukkras  êqutta  ogvëuļa  tnou’elkwa  pal-lši  augwaikštülnàmbu" translates to "An imaginary representation of a nude woman in the midst of descending a staircase in a step-by-step series of tightly-integrated ambulatory bodily movements which combine into a three-dimensional wake behind her, forming a timeless, emergent whole to be considered intellectually, emotionally and aesthetically."(4) It should not be a surprise that Ithkuil was not created with the intention of actually being spoken.%0a%3c %0a%3c I dare the reader to get hired at Duolingo and make Ithkuil a course.%0a%3c %0a%3c Toki Pona:%0a%3c In stark contrast to Ithkuil, Toki Pona is a language intended to be as simple as possible, and highly subject to interpretation. It has just 137 essential words(6), but still functions as a language. As such, it only takes about 30 hours to master(5).%0a%3c %0a%3c (1)https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/conlang-meaning-origin%0a%3c (2)https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners%0a%3c (3)https://www.britannica.com/topic/Esperanto%0a%3c (4)http://ithkuil.net/texts.html%0a%3c (5)https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-smallest-language-has-only-100-words-and-you-can-say-almost-anything-2015-7%0a%3c (6)https://tokipona.org/%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#contentends]]%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expansions:%0a%3c [[#expansions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#expansionsend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c You must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%3c %0a%3c (:else:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Comments%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a%3c !!Change article category%0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:Section: B:)%0a%3c (:Category: Varia:)%0a%3c (:Title: Constructed Languages:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
