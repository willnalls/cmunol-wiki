In comparison with consonants, we have fricatives, stops, approximants, etcetera, which all add some form of obstruction. Each category provided tells us a small portion about the language selected, giving it unique classifications and identity. For example, certain pronunciations could give us hints to where a language may have originated, the culture and lifestyle of its people, or how long it has existed for. In consideration of the presence of common and uncommon consonants, it is interesting to visually map out the various languages and dialects because it gives us yet another hint at why certain distinctions exist. As the video on accents mentioned, a lot of these differences stem from migrations, and the influence of central, longer developed languages. %0a%0aIn general, the english language has a large collection of vowels at its disposal. This appears to be common among heavily populated areas like Europe and Southern Asia. Of course there are plenty of outliers to say differently. Now on the other hand, the native language of Greenland has very few vowels. Ranging from 2-4, all of these vowels exist in the English language. However, they are without the majority of the most common ones in our own language like the [ə], [æ], and [ɔ]. One of the first observations that can be made from this data, is that the Greenlandic vowels are primarily on the 4 distinct corners of the vowel chart. These being the most easily discernible: front vs back, and close vs open. %0a%0aBefore concluding, I would like to establish several hypotheses for the differences in these two languages. Obviously, English has been around for a long time, and also been a heavy factor in colonization around the world. Therefore, it is not surprising that the greenlandic language has no different vowels than english, rather fewer. My guess would be that time and population size are the greatest factors involved. Finally, I am curious about the effects that climate has on language. How much of an impact did this play in Greenland? Or the contrary, in countries closer to the equator?%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
