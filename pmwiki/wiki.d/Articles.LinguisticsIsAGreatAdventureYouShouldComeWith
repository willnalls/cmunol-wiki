And who uses this construction?%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aThe construction of a verb + "with" (abbreviated as "V with") is most common when the verb is "come", "go", or "take" and it is mostly commonly used in the Upper Midwest. Many people have found similar constructions in Germanic and Scandinavian languages "which explains its presence in places like Wisconsin and Minnesota where many Norwegian, Swedish, and German speakers settled."%0a%0aThe syntactic properties of this construction are slightly ambiguous. At first, it may seem that a silent pronoun follows "with". So for example, "do you want to come with?" reads as "do you want to come with me?". However, this analysis leaves out an important property of "V with" which is that "with" acts as a particle. This classification makes using "V with" more limited.%0a%0aA particle is a preposition bound to a verb. For example, "up" is a particle in the expression "get up." Another example is "put on". One of the properties of particles is that they cannot be preceded by adverbs. So, you can say "we walked carefully up the hill" but saying "we got carefully up the hill" is less acceptable. %0a%0aSimilarly, you cannot insert an adverb between a verb and "with" in the "V with" construction. For example, "she should go with" is acceptable while "she should go quickly with" is not. This is why the "with" in the "V with" construction is classified as a particle.%0a%0a%0aNow, let us finish with a meme at this link: %0a%0ahttps://ygdp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/images/come%2520with%2520meme.png%0a%0aSource: https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/come-with%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: F:)%0a(:Category: MorphosyntacticDiversity:)
