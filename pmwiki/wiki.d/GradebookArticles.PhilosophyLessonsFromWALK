If a task is menial and easy it may be a WALK in the park. You may be called a WALKing dictionary or WALKing encyclopedia if you have all the answers or extensive trivia knowledge. In heated situations, you may be asked to take a WALK to cool off or WALK off your nerves or other overwhelming emotions. When you give up or quit you might WALK out on your team. You may abandon your commitment and decide to WALK. Your WALK of life may define you, it may make or break you. After a night on the town, you may find yourself traversing the WALK of shame. You can talk the talk with your words, but may not always be able to WALK the WALK and match your words with your actions. In a nervous, tense situation you may find yourself WALKing on eggshells, cautious of your every move. With difficulty moving, one may require a WALKer. You can use a portable listening device to listen on the go with a WALKman.%0a%0aAs seen by the incredible diversity of the uses of the word “walk”, the Nacirema people seem fascinated by this particular action. The variety of uses not only demonstrates a certain movement of the legs to move oneself forward, but also a metaphorical representation of actions and motion in general. This metaphorical usage of the word “walk” in phrases such as “walk the walk” seems to suggest a concern with demonstrations or actions. The Nacirema culture seem to be extremely concerned with actions and the portrayal or reception of such actions by others. Additionally, the Nacirema people seem to often be on the go. There is evidence of a desire and even a need to contantly be moving forward whether physically or metaphorically.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
