I honestly had never thought about how the deaf community would be affected by facial coverings as I do not know any deaf people but what you describe totally makes sense. I found an article on WebMD (link below) that describes how deaf people are the “forgotten victims” of the Covid-19 pandemic. Facial coverings pose a massive barrier to effective communication for members of the deaf community, but there were rarely, if ever, stories about this in the major media outlets. One proposed solution in the article that I read was to wear a clear mask called, Safe’N’Clear, so that the speakers’ lips and facial expressions are visible. Along this same line of thought I would imagine that the clear face shield that some NFL coaches, such as Andy Reid, wore would also help with the problem of not being able to read lips or see facial expressions.%0a%0aArticle: https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200722/covids-forgotten-victims-the-deaf-community %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
