This language seems to be so flexible that families on their own can develop accents only distinguished by them. For example, a family, who lived remotely in Alaska, developed their own unique accent which also had idioms. I have always found it surprising how ASL users can develop accents that are understandable among different people/cultures. For example, the speed of certain signers is a small detail that can indicate information about someone's culture. Another difference among signers concerning accents is the difference between completely deaf signers and those who are able to hear and sign. I have no experience with sign language but I find it amazing that small details can be passed on through the style of a persons' signing. A question that I have for users of sign language is if there is ever an accent or dialect that is not understood between users. As we have gone over throughout the semester, culture is important and that drives different dialects and accents. I think this may be more difficult for signers but this seems to be another topic that can be looked over more in-depth. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
