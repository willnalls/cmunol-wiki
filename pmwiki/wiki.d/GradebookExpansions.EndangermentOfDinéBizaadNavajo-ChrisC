Clayton Long, the education director for a school district in the Navajo Nation, designed a Navajo-language program for his district that utilizes, among other things, the Duolingo course for Navajo. When he was interviewd in 2018, Long mentioned that he only knew of three other schools that teach Navajo to kids, and is hoping to expand his program to more schools across the US. Another group, Navajo Language Renaissance, has been working to provide resources to learn Navajo using the Rosetta Stone software since 2006. These include 2 levels of Rosetta Stone, a workbook, and an online language test, which are available both for individuals and for use in schools.%0a%0aSources: https://nypost.com/2018/11/24/how-one-man-is-teaching-america-to-speak-navajo/%0ahttps://navajorenaissance.org/history.html%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
