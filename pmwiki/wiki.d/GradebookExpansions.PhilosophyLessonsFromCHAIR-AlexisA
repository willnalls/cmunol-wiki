The verb chair (to install in a chair of authority) comes directly from the noun form and chair as in a position of authority seems to have the same origin. The use of chaëre to mean throne puts into context the English form meaning "to chair a committee," since thrones imply a position of power. Thus, it seems unlikely that the use of the same word for the two major meanings of the English chair implies that English speakers perceive a relationship between the two concepts.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&q=chair&_searchBtn=Search%0ahttps://www.etymonline.com/word/chair#etymonline_v_44622 (my former Latin teacher's favorite etymology website)%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000937-946230#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000937-946230#
