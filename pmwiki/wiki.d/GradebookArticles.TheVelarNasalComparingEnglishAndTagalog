Under Feature 9A, 235 languages listed do not contain the sound at all, while 230 do, English included. Of the 230 languages that do use a velar nasal sound, only 147 languages allow its usage at the start of words. The sound is produced by stopping air with the tongue at the velar position and allowing air to escape through the nasal cavity.%0a%0aIn English, the velar nasal sound typically comes at the end of syllables or at the end of words. Examples include the words: English, sing, angry, fang, etc. Meanwhile, in Tagalog, it is very common for the velar nasal to appear at the start, middle, or end of words. In fact, the Tagalog/Filipino alphabet includes NG as a letter, in addition to N and G. Instances where these occur for all the categories are: (a) ngiti (smile) [ŋɪˈtɪ̆ʔ], (b) mga (plural modifier) [maˈŋa], (c) ng (of) [naŋ].%0a%0aThe difference is in example (a) where the [ŋ] sound is the first sound of the word. This does not occur in English where it typically follows a vowel. It is interesting that English speakers have no trouble pronouncing the velar nasal if it follows a vowel, but when they see it at the start of a word, they are unsure whether to omit the sound completely or to say the [n] and [g] as separate consonants.%0a%0aSources:%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
