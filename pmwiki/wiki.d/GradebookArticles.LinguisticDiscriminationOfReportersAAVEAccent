As a result of this viral encounter and his live reaction, Broxton has become very popular on social media and has been interviewed quite often. However, the main focus of this article is to describe the hard work it took for Broxton to get the job as a tv reporter.%0a%0aBroxton is from Baltimore and says that he grew up “in the hood” and as a result he had a strong AAVE accent. While not explicitly stated in the article, the AAVE accent is commonly associated with being non-rhotic and th-fronting, which is when speakers use the sounds /f/ or /v/ instead of TH. When he was trying to get a job as a reporter, Broxton was rejected many times because his AAVE accent was “too strong” for the studio producer’s liking. After being denied reporter roles many times because of his accent, Broxton decided to get a speech coach in an attempt to “sound like a white person”. Upon completion of the 12-week speech training, Broxton was able to find a job within 3 weeks, but he could barely recognize his own voice. %0a%0aBroxton has been reporting in Montana, surrounded by mostly white people, for 3 years now and says that he had to “completely change who I am” in order to fit in. He now only uses his natural accent when he goes home and is surrounded by other black people. When asked about needing to change his accent Broxton says that there are double-standards with accents. He goes on to question that if Bill Clinton was able to become the President of the United States with a southern accent, why aren’t tv reporters allowed to have an AAVE accent?%0a%0aIn conclusion, this article explains Broxton’s struggle with linguistic discrimination and the steps that he had to take in order to overcome accentism and get a reporter job.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
