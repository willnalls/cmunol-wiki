The EGIDS is between 6b-9 with my guess that it is at 8a because it is mostly elders that speak the language. The reason for the downfall of this language has a large part to do with the government forcing another culture on these native speakers. The Russian-Japanese war is responsible for the displacement of many Ainu speakers and the government imposed a new way of life on the people. In order to survive in the new society, the people were forced to give up their customs. Due to this, the language has become endangered as the language is not being passed on to the next generation and their traditions are dying out. There are still some people that speak the language today, but most of the people that are able to speak Ainu do not feel like they know it well enough to teach to others. This trend is why the language is dying out.
