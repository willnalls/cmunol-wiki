I thought that this question could produce some problematic answers, and in particular the response by Paolo Ferrari caught my attention.

Instead of making a meaningful comparison of the AAVE accent to the Standard American accent, he chooses to characterize the AAVE accent as “ghastly” and “imprecise.” While he doesn’t go into specifics about what aspect of the accent he finds imprecise, I would venture to guess that he could be referring to the reduction of consonant clusters at the ends of words (for instance [tɛst] becomes [tɛs]), the swapping for the ‘θ’ and ‘ð’ sounds for ‘f’ and ‘d’, respectively (“math”: [mæθ] → [mæf] and the: [ðə] → [də]), or exchanging “ɹ” for “ʌ” at the ends of words (“sister”: [sɪstɹ] → [sɪstʌ]), among other AAVE characteristics. %0a%0aIf you consider AAVE through the lens of Standard American English being the “correct” way to speak, some of the characteristics of AAVE may seem “imprecise” or “approximate” as the commenter suggests.
