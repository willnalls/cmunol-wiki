Texting, for example, uses written language and does not carry the same raw emotion as sign language. Recently, however, the increased affordability of hand-tracking technology in VR headsets has offered a potential look into the future.%0a%0aBefore hand-tracking, deaf and mute users may have had a lot of trouble interpreting spoken language in VR. Many VR social games use virtual avatars whose mouths open and close ambiguously when the user is speaking. Without the ability to accurately lip read or sign, many users felt alienated by VR social games.%0a%0aRecently, in communities such as VRChat, users have been able to program downloadable modifications that make it possible to use hand-tracking controllers to approximate sign language gestures and handshapes. However, the technology is far from mature enough to provide a one-to-one experience equivalent to reality. For example, many hand-tracking technologies only consider whether a finger is "gripped" or "open", not allowing for further subtleties such as if a finger is crossed over another to represent letters such as "P" or "Q" in ASL or whether fingers are partially bent. To compensate, VRChat users have come up with a few VR-specific alternatives for many gestures/handshapes, possibly leading to a new digital sign language. %0a%0aA fully functional sign language suite in VR would have many benefits for the deaf and mute communities: for one, it would provide a space for deaf and mute communities to fully express themselves digitally. The system would replace group video chatting which doesn't provide the same sense of proximity and presence as sign language in real life. Many deaf and mute users who may have felt isolated in their local communities would be able to connect with others across the world in a manner unhindered by technologies which may not have considered them as first priorities. Further, it could contribute to the ability to teach students sign language remotely or gamify sign language education for young learners. %0a%0aThere is still much progress to be made in the field of VR sign language, but its development is definitely exciting to follow.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://uploadvr.com/sign-language-vr-asl/%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-vYOlN5qQY%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
