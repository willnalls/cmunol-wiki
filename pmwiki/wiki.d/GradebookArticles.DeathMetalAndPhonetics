Simply using the distortion mechanism with normal speech doesn't make very "brutal" vocals.

It doesn't involve changing any part of the distortion mechanism. The approach to the guttural is quite simple: starting with a normal low scream, make the vowels more back and more close, usually close to [ɯ]. Funnily enough, this could actually be described by the linguistic term "guttural". The reason it sounds so low is because of the nature of vowel overtones: often you can hear a mid-range tone floating over the distortion to give the scream a hollow sound.%0a%0aThe "tunnel throat" technique is a way to make high screams dirty and muddled. Similarly to the guttural, there is no change to the distortion mechanism. Starting with a high scream, make the vowels more front and more close, around [i] or [ɨ]. Usually, the tongue is also much farther forward than for a typical vowel, so it could be described as a syllabic alveolar approximant. Again, the nature of the sound comes from the vowel overtones, which clash with the distorted voice to make the specific tone.%0a%0aThis information is consciously used by death metal vocalists.
