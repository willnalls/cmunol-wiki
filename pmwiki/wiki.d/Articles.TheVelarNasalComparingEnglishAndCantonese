It can appear in the coda such as in the word “ring,” “wrinkle,” but not in the onset. However, the velar nasal in Cantonese can appear both in simple onset (e.g. 我 “I” is pronounced as [ŋɔ̃] or [ŋɔ]) and in the coda of a syllable (e.g. 星 “star” [seŋ]), and it can also be a syllable by itself (五 “five” [ŋ̩]). Since Cantonese doesn’t have consonant clusters, the velar nasal can’t be combined with other consonants in the onset. %0aHowever, the initial velar nasal is being dropped and merged into the null initial by younger speakers of Cantonese. Words with initial velar nasals such as 我”I” [ŋɔ̃], 牙”tooth”[ŋa], 眼”eye” [ŋan], “爱“ [ŋɔɪ], etc., are pronounced as [ɔ], [a], [an], and [ɔɪ] , respectively. The syllabic [ŋ] is also being replaced by [m] in words such as 五“five” and 唔”negation.” The phenomenon of dropping the initial velar nasals is referred to as 懒音, or “lazy sound” translated word for word. Although initial velar nasals do exist in standard Cantonese, it is usually dropped among the younger generations and doesn’t serve a contrastive function anymore, much similar to what has happened to the initial velar nasal in Mandarin a few centuries ago. The reason why Cantonese dropped the initial velar nasal might be that it takes some effort to produce, even for native speakers. Did similar things happen in other languages. From a broader perspective, is it a natural tendency for languages to drop the initial [ŋ], or more generally, is it natural for languages to drop the phonemes which are harder to produce?%0a%0aSource:%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/9A#2/51.0/151.9%0aTo, Carol K.
