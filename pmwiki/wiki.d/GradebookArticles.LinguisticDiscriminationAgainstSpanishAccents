He also replaces vowel sounds like [t] in touch with [θ] and [i] in “peepee” with [ɪ]. These cues simply allow the listener to understand that Rivera is employing a Spanish accent in particular, as he never outright states it.%0a%0aExpanding on the latter example, he forgoes using the proper word (derogatory language warning) “penis” and instead replaces it with “peepee”. Not only does this imply a limited vocabulary of the average native Spanish speaker when speaking English, but it also implies that the manners of Spanish men are improper when speaking to women since they see them as sexual objects. Rivera jokes in the next sentence that the accent grants “no credibility”, which further reinforces the notion.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
