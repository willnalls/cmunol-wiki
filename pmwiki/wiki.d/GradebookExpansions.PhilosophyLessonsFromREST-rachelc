According to the OED, these “rests” have origins from two different languages. The first “rest” comes from the Middle English noun reste which is the same as the German word rast (which means dwell or repose). The second form of the word, on the other hand, comes from the French word “rester”, which means to remain or to linger. Therefore, these words are homophones but have different origins, which would make it extra silly for a Nacerima research to attempt to derive a deeper meaning from the two meanings that this word has. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
