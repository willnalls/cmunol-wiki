Ones money can be EATen up gambling and one might be forced to EAT a bad deal. Not only can you be EATen by a lion but you can also be EATen by pain or disease. Acid EATs its way through metal and a crowd might EAT up propaganda. The people of the Nacirema sometimes command others to EAT dirt or more morbidly EAT their heart out. EAT and its past tense form ATE show up hidden in enormous portions of the language of the Nacirema. One may be bEATen to death or they may chEAT on a test or on their wives. Some common foods also contain the word in whEAT and mEAT. You can have a sEAT in a sEAT. It seems every other artificial substance includes ATE. There are phosphATEs, nitrATEs, and sulfATEs, many of which are inedible, even poisonous. If you have violATEd a law you are an inmATE put behind a gATE. One can make an accurATE estimATE. You can also eliminATE, irritATE, or humiliATE ones enemies.  The number of usages of ATE is truly astounding.  Not only can one MATE a king in chess, but one can MATE another person or returning to the original word, to go to a restaurant is to EAT out but one may also EAT out another individual.%0a%0aAs with all people, the Nacireman must EAT and EATing must be an important part of their culture but its polysemy clearly demonstrates a deep sEATed hATEred for the concept. The Nacireman people detest the very act they need to live, using it to describe so many negatively and potentially sinful acts, so it is natural to conclude that the Nacireman people believe living is inherently sinful and bad. Indeed we see the Nacireman people glorify "dieting" which is to eat as little as possible (some to the point of dEATh) and many bemoan that they are not strong willed-enough to diet.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210327-192948-549350#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Alternate of EAT %0a-> - sirisha_b%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI've never actually realized how many negative contexts the word EAT can be used in, so this was really interesting to read.  The only positive I could think of was if someone is performing or telling a story, the audience could eat it up.  However, I thought about eat in a slightly different way.  I think it shows a lot more about competition and asserting one's dominance over another because in nature, eating was simply that: you either ate food and survived or you were eaten.  Many of the sayings using the word eat, like "eat my words" or "eat out of my hand" show some type of power dynamic where one person is almost subservient to another.  So even though it has negative connotations, there is always one party that greatly benefits from this "eating" and one that suffers a loss.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210327-192948-549350#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210322-033926-946980#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-21.03.2021 - 20:39-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210322-033926-946980 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!bellar%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Just saying nice job :)'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aThis is so funny I love how you used the forms of "eat" in words that don't have anything to do with eating, I didn't even think of that.
