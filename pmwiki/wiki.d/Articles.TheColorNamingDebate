A common argument used to support the relativist side of the debate (arguing that language affects thought) is the phenomenon of color naming across languages and its effect on color cognition.%0a%0aIn a recent Designing Human-Centered Software lecture, we discussed a notable example of this phenomena as presented on BBC Horizons: The Namibian OvaHimba, who have demonstrated exceptionally sharp vision and focus, but are unable to distinguish between certain hues of blue and green. %0a%0aIn English, we are taught from a young age to categorize the different wavelengths of visible light into at least 7 categories: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. In Himba, conversely, there are only five such main categories:%0a%0a*Serandu – reds, browns, oranges and some yellows.%0a*Dambu – a variety of greens, reds, beige and yellows%0a*Zuzu – most dark colours, black, dark red, dark purple, dark blue, etc.%0a*Vapa – some yellows and white.%0a*Buru –a variety of greens and blues.%0a%0a%25center%25%25width=300px%25 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Himba_color_Names.svg/2880px-Himba_color_Names.svg.png | [- %25newwin%25 [[ Wikipedia:Himba_people | Himba]] color categories. -]%0a%0aIt is believed that this difference in categorization leads to a difference in how the OvaHimba perceive colors. For example, when asked to identify the one different color swatch in the following two tests, the OvaHimba were easily able to identify a minutely different shade of green on the left wheel, but had trouble finding the blue swatch on the right wheel. %0a%0ahttp://www.gondwana-collection.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/both-colour-tests-rights-to-media-tumblr.jpg | [hint: both differences are in the same location on the wheel]%0a%0aThe opposite effect can be observed in English speakers, who can quickly identify the blue swatch, but, perhaps due to the fact that there is no categorical linguistic distinction between minutely different shades of green, have difficulty with the left wheel. %0a%0aWhile language is one possible explanation for this difference in color cognition, it is not the only theory.

However, it is only in industrialized modern times that such a huge variety of readily procured colored material selection is available. %0a%0aIn the distant past, many societies have easily created and worked with red and its many shades while finding it difficult to procure blue. As a result, red may have been a strongly distinguished color while blue is not widely recognized and may be grouped with other underused colors that would seem dissimilar to modern people. %0a%0aThe distinction commonly in turn leads to linguistic attention to the prevalent color of red. On the other hand, blue becomes less categorically recognizable due to rarity and low linguistic support.%0a%0aSource:%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210504-023357-125250#%0a#foxbegin 210506-042307-25350#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Cold and Warm Colors %0a-> - VikramM%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAn MIT study probed how warm and cold colors differ in their division of the spectrum and in the number of words used to describe color that fall into each category. In this study the warm colors are considered to be red, orange, and yellow while the cold colors are green, blue.%0a%0aThe study looked at over 100 languages and the general finding was that the warm side of the color spectrum had more words or finer divisions of the colors than the cold side. One possible reason mentioned in the study is that objects or entities in the foreground of a image or setting are often composed dominantly of warmer colors while the backgrounds can be mostly composed of colder colors. %0a%0aThe study does not encompass all languages from all environments, so the researchers may move on the study how color is used in languages in locations with extreme climates such as deserts to see if the relationships between the foreground and background of scenes and color naming are the same. %0a%0aSource: https://news.mit.edu/2017/analyzing-language-color-0918#%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210506-042307-25350#%0a#foxbegin 210506-044557-374330#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Light Blue and Dark Blue %0a-> - shreya_r%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aA similar example is shown in Russian, where there are different words for "light blue" and "dark blue" unlike in English, where both would be considered "blue".

Furthermore, a similar study was conducted some time later on Greek and German speakers (Greek distinguishes between light and dark blue while German does not), in which their ability to detect the difference between light and dark blue was compared to their ability to detect the difference between dark green and dark blue. Similar to the previous study, it was found that Greek speakers performed similarly on both tests while German speakers did much better on the green/blue one.

Instead, descriptions such as “wine-dark sea” were used to describe traditionally blue objects such as the sea. Gladstone and Geiger argued that this was because the term “blue” did not exist in Homer’s time. %0a%0aAnother example is in the development of color terms in Chinese, where the word “靑” was used to describe a whole range of colors from light green to deep blue, before modern terms “藍” and “綠” were introduced to describe blue and green respectively. %0a%0aWhile this does not necessarily mean that the Chinese people or Greek people perceived colors differently from us in ancient times, it is an interesting phenomenon that seems to be repeated in certain cultures around the world.%0a%0aReferences:%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate%0a%0ahttps://oxbridgeapplications.com/kyc/what-colour-is-the-sky/%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%25E2%2580%2593green_distinction_in_language%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210508-005034-149260#%0a#foxbegin 210509-025104-684930#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Hemispheres %0a-> - Russell_E%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI can't find the article where I originally read about this, but here's a link to a different article:%0ahttps://www.nature.com/news/2008/080303/full/news.2008.638.html#:~:text=It%2520is%2520well%2520known%2520that,on%2520the%2520colour%2520one%2520sees.%0a%0aThis article talks about how color perception depends on hemisphere.

In this study the warm colors are considered to be red, orange, and yellow while the cold colors are green, blue.%0a%3c %0a%3c The study looked at over 100 languages and the general finding was that the warm side of the color spectrum had more words or finer divisions of the colors than the cold side. One possible reason mentioned in the study is that objects or entities in the foreground of a image or setting are often composed dominantly of warmer colors while the backgrounds can be mostly composed of colder colors. %0a%3c %0a%3c The study does not encompass all languages from all environments, so the researchers may move on the study how color is used in languages in locations with extreme climates such as deserts to see if the relationships between the foreground and background of scenes and color naming are the same. %0a%3c %0a%3c Source: https://news.mit.edu/2017/analyzing-language-color-0918#%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c #foxend 210506-042307-25350#%0a

However, it is only in industrialized modern times that such a huge variety of readily procured colored material selection is available. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the distant past, many societies have easily created and worked with red and its many shades while finding it difficult to procure blue. As a result, red may have been a strongly distinguished color while blue is not widely recognized and may be grouped with other underused colors that would seem dissimilar to modern people. %0a%3c %0a%3c The distinction commonly in turn leads to linguistic attention to the prevalent color of red. On the other hand, blue becomes less categorically recognizable due to rarity and low linguistic support.%0a%3c %0a%3c Source:%0a%3c https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term%0a%3c %0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c #foxend 210504-023357-125250#%0a---%0a> %0a

A common argument used to support the relativist side of the debate (arguing that language affects thought) is the phenomenon of color naming across languages and its effect on color cognition.%0a%3c %0a%3c In a Designing Human-Centered Software lecture, we discussed a notable example of this phenomena as presented on BBC Horizons: The Namibian OvaHimba, who have exceptionally sharp vision, but are unable to distinguish between certain hues of blue and green. %0a%3c %0a%3c In English, we are taught from a young age to categorize the different wavelengths of visible light into at least 7 categories: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. In Himba, conversely, there are only five such main categories:%0a%3c %0a%3c *Serandu – reds, browns, oranges and some yellows.%0a%3c *Dambu – a variety of greens, reds, beige and yellows%0a%3c *Zuzu – most dark colours, black, dark red, dark purple, dark blue, etc.%0a%3c *Vapa – some yellows and white.%0a%3c *Buru –a variety of greens and blues.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is believed that this difference in categorization leads to a difference in how the OvaHimba perceive colors.
