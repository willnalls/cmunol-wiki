In Hong Kong, 90%25 of the population speaks Cantonese. Although Mandarin is the official language of China, it is perceived as an “outsider’s tongue”. Hong Kong natives would recognize the difference between the two dialects (Mandarin has 4 tonal sounds instead of the 6 in Cantonese, Mandarin has simpler characters whereas Cantonese has the complex traditional ones, etc.) and discriminate against those that spoke a different dialect.

Though it is not as common today, individuals in the city would discriminate against those outside the city by recognizing the subtle differences between Mandarin and Cantonese as outlined above.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
