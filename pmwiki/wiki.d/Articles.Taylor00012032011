It is classified as Critically Endangered by the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger and has approximately 5,000 - 10,000 native speakers. It is classified this way because it is currently used primarily in informal settings and mostly by elderly speakers.

Both languages are head-final, agglutinative, suffixing languages that include verb inflection for tense, mood, aspect, evidentiality, and more grammatical features.
