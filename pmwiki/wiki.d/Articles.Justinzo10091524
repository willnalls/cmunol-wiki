It allows deaf people to communicate with other people who also know ASL(1) but how do words like slang enter into these languages and communities? %0a%0aWell the main way they get added is through constant usage which is actually very similar to the way actual slang is being added to our conversations.(2) If someone uses the slang frequently and enough people hear about it, it would be considered added to our language. We see the same here in ASL albeit through a different process. According to Bill Vicars, president of Lifeprint a company which helps facilitate teaching people ASL through technology, the way he goes about adding signs to his dictionary is by looking online for the most frequent sign usage of the word, then posting it onto his site for his viewers to look at and critique. Languages are always ever evolving but for sign language in particular, it is hard to follow along with new words as there is no set alphabet to at least know how to pronounce the word. As a result, only time would tell whether or not a particular sign for a word would become accepted and a general consensus among communities are needed in order for it to be generalized and used. This can be hard sometimes especially since most discussions go through the internet and there are so many opinions that need to be taken account of. It is also much easier for consensuses to be made when there is a representative of the word/slang. For example, the CEO of 'Gilde' came forward when people were making a sign for the word which gave a much faster consensus rather than instagram which had no representative.(3)%0a%0aSomething interesting to note about ASL is that its non linear and can incorporate multiple dimensions.(4) For example the word 'photobomb' can gain different context if you are doing the sign in the background, foreground, at the center of the crowd or just a singular person. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aSources:%0a1)https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language%0a2,3,4)http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/internet/168477-internet-american-sign-language%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221103-182454-460630#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Accents and Slang %0a-> - hyunsunb%0a-> [-03.11.2022 - 11:24-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221103-182454-460630 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aSince slang in ASL is less standardized than dictionary ASL, the two can be related in their tendencies to be derivations of ASL.
