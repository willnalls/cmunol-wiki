For example, when someone uses the phrase "real good" when speaking with another person, I think it means that the speaker is loosened up and relaxed around the listener.

While if we say the day is going slowly, I feel like it is much more literal as if it  means that the day, just like a person, is actually going/walking slowly.  %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
