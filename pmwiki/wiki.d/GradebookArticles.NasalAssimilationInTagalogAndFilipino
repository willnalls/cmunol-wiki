There are three primary nasal consonants used in a morphological context: [ŋ], [n], and [m]. Note that these three nasal stops are the only nasal stops used in Tagalog. Filipino has [ɲ] but only for Spanish loanwords with ñ, hence it is not used in a morphological context.%0a%0a1. pantao [panˈta.ɔ], adj. human; for humans. %3cpang + tao> where tao is human (noun) and pang modifies the word to be an adjective. Notice the ng [ŋ] assimilates to [n] to match the place of articulation of the first sound of tao [t]. This occurs for all words starting with [d, l, ɾ, r, s, t], also known as dalarasata.%0a%0a2. pambata [pamˈba.taʔ], adj. for children. %3cpang + bata> where bata is child (noun) and pang modifies the word to be an adjective. Notice the ng [ŋ] assimilates to [m] to match the place of articulation of the first sound of bata [b]. This occurs for all words starting with [b, p].%0a%0a3. labing-apat [la.biŋ.a.pat], number 14. %3clabing + apat> where apat is four and labing means +10, similar to how -teen works in fourteen. Notice the ng [ŋ] does not assimilate for vowels. It also applies to other consonants that do not fall under the same place of articulation as [n] or [m].%0a%0aAs you can see from the examples, the place of articulation of the succeeding sound causes an assimilation of the last sound of the prefix. This makes sense because when the prefix is attached to the root word, it may be quite difficult to pronounce the velar nasal and immediately switch to an alveolar or bilabial consonant. Meanwhile, take an assimilation to [n] for example. If the succeeding consonant is [t], then the speaker would simply have to raise their velum to block the nasal cavity (the tongue does not move).%0a%0aThis phenomenon is quite interesting due to its prevalence. While the occurrences shown above are taught in a formal setting, native speakers of Tagalog/Filipino naturally assimilate nasal consonants when speaking quickly. For example: Ang tagal mo! [aŋ ta.gal mɔ] "You're too slow!" when spoken naturally would instead sound like Antagal mo! [an.ta.gal mɔ]. This works for many other phrases, like "ang dilim" => "andilim" which is "it's so dark" and even in swear words (which I will not list here).%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
