Spanish has the alveolar nasal /n/, but also exhibits assimilation in place of articulation depending on the consonant following the /n/. For instance, consider the following four words and their IPA transcriptions:%0a%0a“tener” (to have): [teneɾ]%0a“enfocar” (to focus): [eɱfokaɾ] %0a“encender” (to ignite): [encen̺deɾ]%0a“tengo” (I have): [teŋgo]%0a%0aThese examples show a pattern of assimilating the place of articulation of a nasal before a consonant to the same place of articulation as the consonant. When ‘n’ is followed by a vowel or a consonant articulated at the alveolar ridge, like /s/, the /n/ is used. However, /ɱ/ occurs when the following consonant is labiodental, like /f/. /n̺/ occurs when the following consonant is articulated at the back of the teeth, as is the case for /t/ and /d/ in Spanish (which is lower than the alveolar place of articulation in English). Finally, /ŋ/ occurs when the following consonant is articulated at the velum, like /g/. In general, /n/ is the underlying form and /ɱ/, /n̺/, and /ŋ/ are all allophones of that phoneme.%0a%0aIn assimilation of place of articulation, the mouth configures itself to achieve the place of articulation of the following consonant preemptively, but the tongue or lips fully block air from coming out of the mouth so that it comes out of the nose, making the nasal sound. Then, to articulate the following consonant, the mouth does not move because it is already in the correct place of articulation for the consonant. %0a	%0aEnglish exhibits a similar pattern as well, as we saw in class with the example ‘in France’ where the /n/ in ‘in’ becomes /ɱ/, just like in Spanish. The same goes for /n/ becoming /ŋ/ before velar consonants, like in the word ‘engulf’ ([ɨŋgʌlf]).%0a%0aSource: https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/i.e.mackenzie/neutralir.htm %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: A:)%0a(:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)
