In addition, children learn sign language just like they learn spoken language, as they pick it up from it being used around them. The major difference is that the infants need to know where to look in order to learn the language, rather than just hearing the language. An interesting thing about babies learning sign language is that infant-directed sign language attracts their attention more due to the slow speed of the sign and the large movements. While infants learn sign language, they tend to have a lot of repetition and the location of their signs are off. Just liken spoken language acquisition, infants go through a babble with their hands before they learn words, called a manual babble. First words typically will not appear until 10 months of age. The type of words they learn first is similar to the words that spoken language children learn first, words about their experiences. At 12 months of age, a child can combine a gesture with a word (called semantic one-sign stage) and by 16 months they are at semantic two-sign stage. The difference between these two stages is that the first one deals with a point and word of the same meaning and the second one the point and the word have different meanings. From here, children can learn morphology which uses non-manual markers and space. The non-manual markers can include facial expressions. Non-manual markers are hard for children to master, as they are not fully able to master them until 12 years of age, even though they start learning them at 2 years of age. From here on children learn sentences and structure of a language, at a similar pace to those who learn spoken language. %0a%0aReference: %0aMayberry, R. I., & Squires, B. (2006).
