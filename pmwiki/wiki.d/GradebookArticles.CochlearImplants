While hearing aids are external devices used to amplify sound, CIs require surgical implantation. They work by bypassing damaged areas and "directly simulating the auditory nerve". Deaf people are unable to hear because of a damaged cochlea (auditory nerve), which is essentially replaced by the CI. The signals are then sent down the path of the auditory nerve to the brain which can then identify and process as sound. The audio heard through a CI is different than that of the natural auditory nerve and takes time to adapt, but it can allow deaf individuals to hear environment sounds and listen/understand to speech once trained.%0a%0aSo why are CIs controversial within the deaf community?%0a%0aThe deaf community perceives CIs as a insult to their community as they feel that they are already able to live full capable and functional lives. Thus, they feel that having deaf children receive CIs is a threatening act from the hearing majority towards the deaf minority. The deaf community's perception is that nothing needs to be fixed, and our perception (the hearing community) is that something needs to be fixed and we should assist them. It spreads the idea that this group of people needs "fixing". Deaf culture is like any other minority group and would like to preserve itself to maintain a supportive community.%0a%0aAnother controversial aspect of CIs is that they are not a miracle cure as many hearing individuals view it as. The initial installation is very mentally taxing and exhaustive, ringing background noises are often common until the brain adapts, certain environments are still difficult to hear in, and some users may never be able to fully understand conversation. Lastly, many hearing parents will often fail to teach their deaf child ASL once a cochlear is installed following the belief that it is a miracle cure.%0a%0aCochlear Implants threaten the deaf community by indicating that they need fixing and are often not an ideal solution to deafness.
