I have a personal connection to the Apache people because their culture, although mostly brutally erased in the last few centuries, still flourishes in the West Texas/New Mexico area of my childhood. I used to hike up to a group of caves they created in the Franklin Mountains, and I grew up taking day trips to the Carlsbad Caverns, a land in which the Apache are very spiritually tied to. My family used to even go to some of their reservation-based enterprises, including the ski resort, “Ski Apache”, as well as their casino and hotel “Inn of the Mountain Gods”. %0a%0aThe Mescalero Apache currently are represented by a tribal government composed of a Tribal Council, a President and a Vice-President. The traditional stewards of the land were chiefs and spiritual guides (including Geronimo (1829-1909), Mangas Coloradas (1797-1862), and Victorio (around 1825-1880)). The Apache were known as fierce warriors of the mountains, plains, and deserts long before white people arrived. The name Apache comes from the neighboring Pueblo tribe’s word for “enemy”, Apachu. There are three main branches of the Mescalero Apache people: Mescalero, Lipan and Chiricahua. Each group has separate dialects, and in their languages, the Apache call themselves Tinneh, Tinde, Dini, or something similar, which means “the people.” More specifically, they call their tribe Shis-Inday, or "People of the Mountain Forests''. Today, the Apache people use the word “Apache'' in their own orthographies, but spell it Abachi or Abaachi. The word “Mescalero” actually comes from the Spanish -ero, meaning "people of," and mescale, meaning "agave", because after the Spanish arrived, they saw how dependent this tribe was on the Mescal Agave root for a carbohydrate source. Mescalero Apache is the preferred name, transcribed, [meskaleɾo apatʃe].%0a%0aSpanish, Mexican, and American Treaties all recognize the The Mescalero Apache Reservation spanning across parts of New Mexico and Texas, established by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. More members were added to the reservation from other tribe divisions when the treaty was reorganized by the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act.%0a%0aThe language of the Mescalero Apache people, Ndé Bizaa’, or Western Apache, is a part of the Athabaskan (Na-Dene) Language Family, and is closely related to Navajo. It is a tone language with polysynthetic verbs. There are currently around 57,000 people of the Mescalero Apache tribe (according to the U.S. Census), but only 15,000 remaining speakers of the language. There are efforts for language revitalization, including online pedagogical tools being developed, available dictionaries, and grammar guides. There is also a language-immersion school for Mescalero. Today, the language is still in use, but only ceremonially and domestically in homes.%0a%0aIf I were to write a summary on the Mescalero Apache off of Wikipedia, I wouldn’t be able to get nearly as wide of a perspective as I can on tribal-written sources. The facts would change because they’d be written mostly from the point of Spanish colonization and onward, and the presentation would change because they are framed from a more universal and less specific perspective. On Wikipedia, I also found a wide variety of names that the tribe is called, but I’m not sure how linguistically accurate it is. The language is described in a way of short factoids, rather than the longer more holistic approach on the indigenous sources. Additionally, the language of the Meskalero people is generalized on Wikipedia, because the page for it is called “Mescalero-Chiricahua language”, which portrays the Mescalero language as the same as the language of the nearby Chiricahua people. These two languages actually have many linguistic differences, and are about as related as Spanish and French, according to the indigenous sites.%0a%0aLinks:%0ahttps://mescaleroapachetribe.com/%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/apache.htm%0ahttps://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-apache/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescalero-Chiricahua_language%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221657-62460#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221657-62460#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
