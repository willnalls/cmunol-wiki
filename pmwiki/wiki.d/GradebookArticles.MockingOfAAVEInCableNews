The political commentator provides a mock reading of a sample line from the song lyrics, giving emphasis on specific phrases that he believes to be “incorrect” or “ungrammatical”. This is tied into a statement made by another commentator about how hip-hop music has “done more damage to young african americans than racism has in recent years,” referencing the usage of AAVE in the lyrics as well as the beliefs present in the lyrics. %0aTwo specific instances of AAVE are emphasized as “incorrect” in the mock reading of the song lyrics in the link. The first instance of AAVE which is emphasized by the commentator is the usage of final consonant deletion / final consonant cluster reduction. In the song lyrics, “for sure” is pronounced as [foʊ ʃoʊ], in which the post-vocalic /ɹ/ is deleted and unvocalized. The second instance of AAVE which is emphasized by the commentator is the usage of fricative stopping, where /ð/ is realized as [d] or [v], in the pronunciation of “that”. %0aThe impression given by the mock reading of the song lyrics by the commentators is that of disparagement towards the usage of AAVE. The intention of the mock reading was to highlight the supposed failure of AAVE in providing thoughtful political commentary and showing that AAVE was less correct and grammatical in an academic context. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
