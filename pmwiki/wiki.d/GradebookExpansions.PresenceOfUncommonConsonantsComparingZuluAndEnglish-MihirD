Many South Africans converse in languages such as English, Afrikaans, Zulu, and Xhosa. In this environment, automatic speech recognition (ASR) is difficult, as the amount of data available for a particular language  (such as Zulu on its own) may be limited. Traditionally, algorithms to transcribe Zulu would have to train on the limited data available. In the case of Zulu and Xhosa, using a pretrained model for a language such as English as a starting point may not work, as the unique clicks would have to be learned from scratch. The paper "Language-dependent state clustering for multilingual acoustic modelling" discusses how combining datasets of South African English, Afrikaans, Zulu, and Xhosa leads to a more efficient algorithm over separate algorithms for separate languages using separate data.%0a%0aThis is likely due to many similarities in phonology between Zulu and Xhosa. Both languages have several features in common, such as all the click sounds. By combining this data, the multilingual model can more efficiently learn to discern clicks, which are very similar between these two languages. In addition, Afrikaans and South African English share some amount of phones with Zulu and Xhosa as well. %0a%0aWhile having a unique set of phones (clicks) is a disadvantage for natural language processing algorithms due to limitations of available data, pooling data from languages that share similar sounds may be useful for making more useful models. %0a%0aSource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167639307000611%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000435-476690#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000435-476690#%0a(:GradedBy: :)
