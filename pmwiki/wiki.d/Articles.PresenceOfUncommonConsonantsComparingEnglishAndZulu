In this article, the author discusses how Zulu and Xhosa (two closely related languages) clicking sounds are acquired by both native speakers and by English speakers.

The theory discussed is called the LH (left-Hemisphere) advantage, and employed a study which assessed Zulu vs. English speakers’ click recognition.

For instance, English has the uncommon “th” sound, otherwise known as the dental fricative. This dental fricative category includes both the unvoiced [θ] and the voiced [ð], and is present in only around 43 languages. The Zulu people don’t have dental fricatives, but they frequently use clicks in their language. Zulu contains 4 different clicks: the bilabial P click [ʘ], the dental C click [ǀ], the palatoalveolar X click [ǂ], and the postalveolar [ǃ] Q click.

Zulu clicking produces some of the loudest consonants in any language, while languages like Sandawe and Hazda have more subtle clicking, often mistaken for ejectives. In contrast, the English dental fricative is produced by the tip of the tongue being placed behind the top front teeth, paired with passage of air either with the vocal folds vibrating (producing [ð]), or resting (producing [θ]).%0a>  %0a> I found it interesting that some linguists think that the reason clicking is so uncommon is because it requires more muscular force than other consonants (some clicks require suction of the tongue). They also found that it is also more common in people with smaller alveolar ridges. These findings left me wondering; can infants just as easily acquire clicking as they can the English dental fricative, or is it more difficult because they don’t have the developed muscular structures? %0a>  %0a> Sources:%0a> %0a> https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-click-speech-is-rare/#:~:text=Click%2520sounds%252C%2520such%2520as%2520those,Africa%252C%2520make%2520perfectly%2520good%2520consonants.&text=These%2520allowed%2520less%2520air%2520to,an%2520anatomical%2520bias%2520against%2520clicks.%0a>  %0a> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant#:~:text=Anatomically%252C%2520clicks%2520are%2520obstruents%2520articulated,a%2520lingual%2520ingressive%2520airstream%2520mechanism%0a>  %0a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHHGOYu6Fl0%0a>  %0a> %0a> %0a> [[#contentends]]%0a> ----%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!Expansions:%0a> [[#expansions]]%0a> %0a> [[#expansionsend]]%0a> %0a> ----%0a> %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a> %0a> (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a> %0a> (:else:)%0a> %0a> (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a> %0a> (:ifend:)%0a> %0a> ----%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!Comments%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (:section: :)%0a> (:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
