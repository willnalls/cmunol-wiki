However, some reasons for the extinction of signed languages differ from those commonly found in the extinction of spoken languages. Speakers of signed languages are typically split into two categories, “urban sign language”/”national sign language”, or “rural sign language”. The urban/national sign language community generally describes speakers concentrated around major cities and deaf schools, where the majority of hearing people do not use sign language. In contrast, “rural sign language” (also known as village sign language) typically develops in rural areas where a lack of social contact (in terms of an available gene pool) can lead to larger incidences of deafness, leading signed languages to develop. These signed languages are used by those who are hearing and deaf alike, and are in some cases used alongside instances of spoken language. In these “rural sign language” communities, signed languages can go extinct due to a decrease in the number of deaf individuals (usually related to diversification in the available gene pool of certain communities). This is in contrast to spoken languages, where the majority of language death is not a direct result of the disappearance of a certain group of people. More controversially, signed languages can disappear as a result of eugenic policies and mandates. For example, in Adamorobe (a village in eastern Ghana) a policy was put into place forbidding deaf individuals to marry each other, and as such the deaf population (and subsequently the use of Adamorobe Sign Language) decreased around 10%25  in 50 years. %0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamorobe_Sign_Language%0ahttps://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/12/96/81/129681979560727324424065691676610323327/SignLanguageRevitalizationChapter_author_preprint.pdf%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language#Technology%0ahttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/race-to-save-hawaii-sign-language%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221204-211102-725420#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Indigenous and Original sign languages %0a-> - adrian%0a-> [-04.12.2022 - 13:11-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221204-211102-725420 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThere are also many indigenous and original sign languages that are endangered.
