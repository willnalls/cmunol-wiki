First off, TikTok as a noun and a platform, has existed for almost six years and has reached 154 countries worldwide, and more importantly has been used in almost all of the 67 English-speaking countries (1). The platform reached more than 1 billion users on September 7th, 2021, and is expected to reach more than 1.8 billion by the end of 2022. There are also more than 138 monthly active users in the United States (2). Its widespread usage across the globe, but more importantly in large English-speaking countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, begs the question of why the usage of such a word as a verb, which is used among lots of younger English speakers, doesn’t exist in the OED, but the world “to tweet” on Twitter does.%0a	“To tiktok” simply means to create a post on TikTok (3). Its appearance in the Collins dictionary proves further sustained usage. In the online age and the constant connection of Gen-Z users to the internet, social media verbiage has been sustained. For example the word “to snap” or “to instagram” has sustained use across America’s English speaking population in relation to the social media platforms Snapchat, and, of course, Instagram. The word is quoted in relation to the noun “video-sharing” in EOD, displaying already a relevant sustained and known use among users of the word “video-sharing”(4).%0a	Ultimately, this TikTok should end up on the OED or I’ll tiktok something to rant about it *maybe*.%0a%0a%0aSources:(1)https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/#:~:text=Revenue%2520%25E2%2580%2593%2520TikTok%2520is%2520estimated%2520to,(and%252075%2520different%2520languages).

I believe TikTok is just another trend, albeit quite a successful one, but will die off at some point. In response to your comparison to Twitter, Twitter has been around since 2006, and was most popular from 2007-2010 (1), so it has more of a 'sustained' usage. Also, in my personal experience, most people would say, "do you want to make a tiktok?" instead of "do you want to tiktok?" The verb would have to be more collaborative in this way, versus with Twitter, tweets are usually done solo. Additionally, "do you want to tiktok" is unclear.
