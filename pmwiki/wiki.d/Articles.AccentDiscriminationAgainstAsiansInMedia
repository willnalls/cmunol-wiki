On top of all the other stereotypical features that are perpetuated in the show about the character, the accent is perhaps the most easily mocked element of Apu's character. As the author of the New Yorker article states,  "Apu's most distinguishing trait is his accent: theatrically thick, as though someone is luxuriating in all those exotic curled R's and the nasally twang." The character is made fun of for having a thick accent since it falls outside the prescriptivist language and sounds that most non-POC are used to hearing. This portrayal of the character has real negative impacts; it paints all Indians with a broad brush and leads to Indian-Americans being bullied and mocked in society.  Moreover, since it is common to roll the R, (so [ʀ] instead of [ɹ]) when speaking, this leads to them taking accent reduction classes in an attempt to sound more "eloquent" and further erases part of their identity. The dialect that is being made in fun of through Apu is the Hindi dialect. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210503-034038-690720#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Do cartoons really impact people's persepective %0a-> - sathyas%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aOne idea I am curious about is whether people's perspective of Indians is really effected by the cartoon and Apu's accent.
