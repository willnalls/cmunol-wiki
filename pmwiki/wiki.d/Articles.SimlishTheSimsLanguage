If you don’t know what Simlish is, here’s an example I found on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsZhiOhUVg Simlish was developed especially for the game to allow players to imagine the conversations between characters rather than just listening to a script. It’s interesting to me because the way that the Sims talk sounds so similar to English, yet we can’t understand a single word that they’re saying. %0a%0aIn the early stages, the developers tried to sort of combine languages including Navajo, Ukranian, and more, but ended up not being satisfied with the results, as it was still kind of recognizable. The Simlish language is pretty much just gibberish that comes from improvising from the voice actors. The language itself doesn’t have much syntax or morphology because of this, and has been compared to “baby talk”. Since the voice actors were English speakers, you can tell that the Simlish language pretty much follows English phonetics. A really big part of Simlish is that you can feel the emotion behind the speech and it helps communicate the main idea, even if you can’t say what exactly they are saying. %0a%0aI found this cool article (https://ejlinguist.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/a-phonology-of-simlish/) that goes into detail about the phonotactics of Simlish if you want to read about the specifics, but I found it really interesting that there are clear similarities between English and Simlish. Some of the differences that the author found, including lack of dental phonemes in Simlish, as well as a maximum of only two consonants in the onset of words. %0a%0asources:%0ahttps://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126705/the-sims-simlish-language-history-20th-anniversary-game%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGsbeTV76YI%0ahttps://ejlinguist.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/a-phonology-of-simlish/%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: B:)%0a(:Category: LinguisticDiscriminationInTheWild:)
