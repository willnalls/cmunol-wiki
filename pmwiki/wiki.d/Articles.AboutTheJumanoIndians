I visited around three years ago now and I learned very little about Indigenous people native to the land, so now is my opportunity to learn more. The Jumano people occupied a wide majority of land, with a small area that I found around Sedona. The majority of their land is found in Texas, northern Mexico, and New Mexico. Based on the Indigenous sources about the Jumano, the small area I found of this tribe makes sense, since historically they had a scattered distribution across this general southwest region. The Jumano were called a variety of names, like Patarabueys by Spanish raiders (a general name for Indians in that region) and multiple different names throughout historical literature, like Humana, Jumana, Xoman, and more. The name of Jumano (dɜumæno is my approximation of its pronounciation) is now the correct term used in literature today. %0aThe area observed here in Texas and New Mexico, while there are no reported treatises specifically involving the Jumano people, included some treatises between indigenous tribes and the white settlers. An important treatise is the Bird's Fort treatise, which called for no more war between the two groups. %0aUnfortunately, the Jumano people and their language are considered extinct, with no surviving detailed records about their language. Only around three hundred people currently claim to be of Jumano heritage, and though there could be thousands more, they are not recognized as a tribe in the modern-day. Their language was described as a form of Tiwa or Tanoan language, but all guesses are mere speculation due to the lack of documentation. %0aBecause of their 'disappearance', few sources even cover or discuss the Jumano tribe. This causes the few sources available (even the sources linked by the map) to be questionably written or from questionable authorities. Many of the non-Indigenous sources I found try to make the tribe sound completely gone from the face of the earth. When we look closer though, there are people still around who identify with their Jumano heritage and identity. The language of the Jumano people, in non-Indigenous sources, is glazed over and simply mentioned in reference to other languages. Overall, specific details of the Jumano language are scarce and it appears there are no modern speakers. So although there is a movement to revitalize the tribe of the Jumano, the language seems to be gone. %0a%0aThe sources I used for this article are as follows:%0ahttps://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/jumano-indians%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanos%0ahttp://www.texasindians.com/jumano.htm%0ahttps://www.jumano-nation.com/%0ahttp://www.coppellhistoricalsociety.org/birds-fort-treaty.html#:~:text=The%2520Treaty%2520of%2520Bird's%2520Fort,the%2520white%2520settlers%2520in%2520Texas.%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-220841-992050#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-220841-992050#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
