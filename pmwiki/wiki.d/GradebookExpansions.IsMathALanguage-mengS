I believe that language simply needs to serve the communicative needs the community that uses them, not every being in the world. As you mentioned, users can usually write mathematical statements using existing symbols, which means Math does serve the needs of the mathematical community. In fact, the Amazonian tribe, Amondawa, do not have a way to express time nor have numbers beyond four or five, unlike most languages in the world. Yet, their system of communication they use is still considered a language, since it does help the community convey their thoughts to one another. Perhaps Math is not a language in the conventional sense, but it’s still a language nonetheless.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000935-875760#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000935-875760#%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
