For example, TABLES are often used to write and can be used to record statistics and measurements. Many words that have a meaning related to measurement or statistics are also referred to using "table". For example, data is represented in tables, the phrase "bringing to the table" is used to measure a person's contribution, and the phrase "under the table" is used as a measurement of drunkenness.
