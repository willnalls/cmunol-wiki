As we can see, there is the medial consonant deletion (of [l] and [ɹ]) as well as the diphthongization of the first vowel in the sentence (the length of the vowel sound is extended and is characterized by two different vowel sounds put together). Finally, the change from /ɔ/ to /a/ and /ɐ/ also involves a change in the backness of the vowel.
