This article discusses this difference as well as the notion of complexity of a language.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aHindi and English differ in many typological features, one of which is their consonant inventories. A consonant inventory is the set of all of the different consonant (i.e., not vowel) sounds which are used in the language; thus, a larger consonant inventory indicates the usage of more consonants in that language. The consonant inventory feature can take on 5 values in WALS, ranging from small to large. Deciding which consonants to include in the inventory can be a difficult task, particularly since many languages borrow words from other languages and some of these borrowed words include consonants that are not typically found in the original language. Additionally, it can be difficult to determine what exactly counts as “distinct” consonant sounds. %0a%0aHindi has a larger consonant inventory than English; according to PHOIBLE, there are 24 distinct consonant sounds present in English, and there are about 10 more present in Hindi than in English. According to Aspects of Hindi Phonology by Manjari Ohala, stops (plosives) are very frequently found in Hindi words; these include the sounds [p], [b], [t], [d], [k], and [g], and variations of these. Additionally, alveolar sounds are also very common in Hindi, including [z], [n], and [r]. This is in contrast to the high level of fricatives and approximants present in English, such as [ɹ] and [s].%0a%0aOne interesting notion which is mentioned in the WALS chapter on consonant inventories is the idea that since some languages are much more complex in their consonant inventories, there must be other typological features in which they are less complex than other languages. This hypothesis stems from the fact that all languages are effective in allowing its speakers to communicate thoroughly with each other, so they are more or less “on the same playing field” with regards to complexity. While I think this is an interesting idea (and it seems to be supported by an initial glance into the vowel inventories for English and Hindi, which show the opposite pattern as the consonant inventories), I disagree. Some languages are much older than others and have had time to develop more complex features than others; while I agree that any particular language cannot have the most complex form of every typological feature, and that there must be some balance, I believe some languages can generally be more complex than others. Either way, it is an interesting question which relies on how “complexity” is defined.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
