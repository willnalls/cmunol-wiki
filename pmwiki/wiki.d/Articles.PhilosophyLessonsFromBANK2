For instance, the first and most mainstream definition refers to the financial institution- “We’re going to the BANK to deposit money”. BANK can take the form of both noun and verb; you can deposit money in your BANK, but also “make BANK” or “BANK”. To say you’re making a lot of money, you could say “I’m BANKING”. It can even be used as an adjective, as in a BANK account. Alternatively, BANK could also be used in the context of river BANK, or less specifically, a mound or slope of a particular substance. BANK can also be used as a verb in this context to indicate the act of heaping up something- “the rain BANKED up all the mud”. Moreover, the word can be used to indicate several ordered groups of the same thing; for example, “BANKS of lights.” %0a%0aThe word bank is used by the Nacirema in unique and exotic forms. For example, they have been observed to assign a multitude of different meanings and phrases, not connected in the slightest, to the word. The Nacirema frequently hold a ceremony of receiving an extraterrestrial and abstract substance they call yenom from their distributor (who frequently performs less tasks and labor than the actual workers), and transferring the made-up numbers into something they call a “bank account”. This also refers to the facility where the fake computer-generated numbers are counted and kept safe from others, called a bank. Their belief system suggests that yenom is the god that determines an individual’s survival or quality of life. The Nacirema culture puts yenom at the forefront, which opens up an extreme variety of uses for and phrases of the word bank, such as use as both adjective and verb. The polysemy of the Nacirema’s word bank can be seen in its completely unrelated context, referring to a pile of mud where the edges of their rivers collide with. This can also be used as a verb meaning to heap something up. For some reason, the Nacirema belief system and culture assigns many different unrelated meanings to the same series of sounds. The variety of words and phrases using “bank” also speaks to their obsession with yenom, a made-up mostly invisible substance that the Nacirema allow to control their lives. They use this substance as justification for making some of their population starve or be homeless, once again suggesting their central obsession with making things harder than they have to be.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: E:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)
