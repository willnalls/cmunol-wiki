Kirsten Betancurt, a member of the Hoocąk, believes the extinction of the language will lead to the extinction of the culture. She has quit her job in order to be a Language Apprentice. The Language Apprenticeship program is a special reclamation program started by and for the Hoocąk community. Through this program, apprentices are paired with a speaker, who they spend up to two years with (every weekday, seven hours a day) learning the language. After they complete their Apprenticeship, they become a Hoocąk instructor for children attending Hoocąk High Schools and other adults. Betancurt characterized this Language Apprenticeship program as the bridge between the  elder Hoocąk community, who learned Hoocąk as a first language, and younger generations. %0a%0a%0aSource: https://www.neh.gov/article/reviving-ho-chunk%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
