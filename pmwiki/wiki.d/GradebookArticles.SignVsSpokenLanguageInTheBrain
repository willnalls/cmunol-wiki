For instance, there are two main areas of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in the production and perception of spoken language. These are the Broca’s area (speech production) and the Wernicke’s Area (language perception). When I first learned about these areas of the brain, I was taught about them solely with respect to spoken languages, and told that visual and spatial functions/reasoning are handled mainly by the right hemisphere of the brain. However, this is not necessarily the case when it comes to sign language.%0a%0aWhile the right hemisphere of the brain is definitely involved in the production and perception of sign language, it is not true that the Broca’s and Wernicke’s area are not involved at all. Studies have shown that Broca’s area is involved in the production of sign language just as much as it is involved in the production of spoken language, implying that the Broca’s area is not responsible just for speech production, but rather language production as a whole. %0a%0aStudies have also shown that the same parts of the right hemisphere light up when observing sign language, as when observing other gestures such as movement of hands, body, or face. However, when observing sign language in particular, the Wernicke’s area also lights up, (it doesn’t light up when just a random gesture is perceived). This implies that, just as the brain is able to distinguish between sound and language, the brain is able to assign some specific linguistic meaning to gestures and then differentiate between linguistic gestures and just regular ones. %0a%0aAll of this together implies that the brain is “specialized in language per se, not [just] in speaking” (Patrick C. Trettenbrein of MPI CBS). Overall, this has taught me a lot about the brain and shown that sign and spoken language are more similar than I previously thought.%0a%0aSources:%0a%0ahttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210219124236.htm%0a%0ahttps://theconversation.com/what-sign-language-teaches-us-about-the-brain-29628#:~:text=More%2520videos%2520on%2520YouTube,-Switch%2520camera&text=If%2520Broca's%2520area%2520is%2520involved,%252C%2520surprisingly%252C%2520they%2520do%2520not.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
