I think that even if the apes' grunting itself made no sense, the order of grunting noises that sound differently might have been key to encoding information. For example, a short grunt followed by a long grunt meaning something different from a long grunt followed by a short grunt would be an example of language, I think.%0a%0aAside from this, the article talks about the possible existence of the first genes that made language possible.
