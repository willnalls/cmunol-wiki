For example, the statement “the rabbit is to the left of the giraffe” defines the position of the rabbit relative to that of the giraffe. Likewise, the statement “I am walking forward” defines the speaker’s direction of motion relative to their current position.%0a%0aHowever, in the Guugu Yimithirr language, spatial coordinates are described using the four cardinal direction roots, similar in meaning to north, south, east and west. Thus, rather than using the position and orientation of reference objects such as the speaker themselves to define position or direction, a speaker of the Guugu Yimithirr language would use geocentric coordinates which are independent of specific terrain or the rotation of any reference objects. For example, a statement in the Guugu Yimithirr language might be “the rabbit is north of the giraffe”. %0a%0aA common argument made is that speakers of the Guugu Yimithirr language have a very strong sense of orientation and can instinctively “feel” which direction is north, south, east or west. There are even suggestions, based on psychological studies, that speakers of the Guugu Yimithirr language experience or remember “the same reality differently” from speakers of languages with a more familiar spatial coordinate system to us. This is used as evidence for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of language affecting thought, even though there is disagreement on the strength of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis it supports (eg the strong or weak version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis). There are many studies conducted on speakers of the Guugu Yimithirr and other similar languages, which deserve greater analysis. %0a%0aOne thing to note is that much of the literature on the Guugu Yimithirr language, particularly with respect to its spatial coordinate system, are written by non-indigenous sources. It is difficult to find an indigenous source describing the spatial coordinate system of the language. While we should not automatically dismiss the existing literature solely based on this issue, it would be interesting and helpful to find an indigenous source on the Guugu Yimithirr language to see if additional insights into the language system can be obtained.%0a%0aReference:%0a%0ahttps://pages.ucsd.edu/~jhaviland/Publications/ETHOSw.Diags.pdf%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guugu_Yimithirr_people%0a%0ahttps://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
