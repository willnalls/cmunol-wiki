Reports and interviews suggest that there is a "toxic" attitude towards students with a regional dialect/pronunciation, such as a northern England accent. The article also points out that this is not only discrimination against accents but also an instance of classism, where students are targets by their socio-economical background.%0a%0aWhile it is sad to believe that communities in Higher Education suffer from issues like this, it certainly exists. When I was in middle school, I participated in an exchange program to a well-reputed grammar school in the UK (a Grammar school in the UK is somewhat equivalent to a private school). Back then, I and some of my friends spoke English with a noticeable accent. By the end of the program, my classmates in the program who spoke with less accent blended into the host school's community much better. Some I have reasons to believe that discrimination does exist in prestigious institutions.%0a%0aAs a second language speaker of English, while I strive to speak the best Standard American English as I could, it is in all of our best interest to combat accent discrimination.

The parent concludes by saying he thinks the Yorkshire accent makes people unintelligent and that people with Yorkshire accents aren't taken seriously.
