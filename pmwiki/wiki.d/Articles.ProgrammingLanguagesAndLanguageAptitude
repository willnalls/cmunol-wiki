I learned many different programming languages over the years: Java and C++ in high school and Python in college. I always wondered why there are multiple programming languages and how difficult it would be to learn new ones. Initially, I assumed that the better at programming and computer science one is, the more kiley they will be able to pick up a programming language.%0a%0aIn the article linked below, an experiment was done in order to see how different people learned these programming languages. Like myself, many others also thought that math skills would be a determinimg factor in learning quickly. However, it was found that a significant 20%25 of the quickness in learning was accounted for by language aptitude. Those who were able to pick up on language quickly were also able to pick up on programming languages.%0a%0aIt is interesting to see how similar and related topics like computer science can be to linguistics. It also encourages people to learn programming languages without being afraid to due to their lack of "computer science knowledge" and abiliies. %0a%0aArticle: https://massivesci.com/articles/programming-math-language-python-women-in-science/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-225643-421860#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!A Likely Explanation for this Phenomenon %0a-> - ayush_d%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aJust like spoken language, programming languages also have notions of syntax and semantics.

Many people seem to think it takes a lot of effort to learn a new programming language; I think this is a misconception.
