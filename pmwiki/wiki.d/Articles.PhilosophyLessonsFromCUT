They inhabit a great land, edged by two oceans. An idle kind, they are one of the heaviest on the planet. Instead of walking on two legs or CUTting on diets, many prefer to sit in a chair staring at a variety of magic machines. These staring rituals may last for hours, and often CUT into normal sleeping hours. Despite humans being diurnal, many of the Nacirema seem to have evolved an ability to stare at these magic machines throughout the night, CUTting sleep to just a purely daytime affair. Another ritual involves thousands of the Nacirema. They sit around in a grand structure overlooking a vast CUT of grass with religious markings. Two groups of 10 or so of their Men run around on the grass, wearing masks that imprison their faces and attire that inflates the shoulders. A lead Man shouts aggressive chants, right before 5 or so men from the other group charge hungrily at him. The lead Man throws a brown object shaped like a CUT potato at another man from his group, perhaps avoiding the savagery. As soon as the ball leaves his hands, the hungry men from the other group switch their focus to whoever catches the potato, CUTting towards him swiftly. They run towards him in an attempt to grope the man carrying the ball. Not many of the Nacirema are CUT out for this type of activity. It is unclear as to why they perform these rituals, but further study of the Nacirema is required for more reliable conclusions.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: :)%0a(:Category: FunWithWords:)%0a(:Title: Philosophy lessons from CUT:)%0a(:if [ authgroup @tas || authgroup @admins || equal {$Author} '' ]:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=edit|Edit this page]] \\%0aStatus: {GradebookArticles.{$Name}$:Status} %0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!{$:Category}]]%0a%0a!Philosophy lessons from CUT%0a%0a:Author: williamh57%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aLearning CUT from the Nacirema%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aI need to get my hair CUT.
