One way that this has been prominently displayed is often not through a concerted effort to discriminate against this community but simply a lack of care about them. The Limping Chicken, one of the most popular deaf blogs in the world discusses this issue in context with the last Super Bowl. Unlike other countries, the United States accessibility laws do not require many public domain television broadcasts to include sign language interpretation. Despite this, the NFL declared their intentions to include ASL performers and interpreters as part of the national anthem and halftime show. Unfortunately, when it came to execution these performers where almost left entirely out of the shot and when they were shown during the halftime show there was literally another person who was blocking half of the camera. Ultimately, it feels that the needs of this community were simply pushed aside and forgotten by the event organizers. Two other cases where this lack of care is obvious is in a 2017 police press conference as well as during the 2013 Nelson Mandela Memorial. In both cases the "interpreter" present simply did not know any sign language and simply made completely gibberish hand signs during the speeches. Once again, this simple lack of care is just awful. Even worse in the case of the police press conference, they were discussing a criminal, and one of the victims' mother was deaf. Ultimately, all of these events show that people simply don't respect this community enough to care about providing equal accessibility to them and that needs to change.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/12/11/250179179/fake-sign-language-interpreter-marred-mandela-memorial%0ahttps://limpingchicken.com/2022/02/14/super-bowl-sparks-controversy-from-deaf-community-over-sign-language-visibility/%0ahttps://www.wcpo.com/news/national/fake-sign-language-interpreter-behavior%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221210-031131-878570#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Discrimination Against Sign Languages by Police %0a-> - jackagui%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 19:11-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-031131-878570 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAs many police officers do not know sign language, communication between police officers and deaf civilians is often poor, which often results in unnecessary violence.%0a%0aA friend of my mom is deaf, as is his wife and two kids.
