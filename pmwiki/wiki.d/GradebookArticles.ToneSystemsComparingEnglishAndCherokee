In some languages, tone creates an implicit meaning -- essentially hinting at a certain context. In other languages, tone can explicitly change the meaning of a word because it is a part of the language in the first place. A language that explicitly changes the meaning of a word based on tone has a tone system. In this case, tone is characterized as a change in pitch. This change in pitch is specific to a certain word or syllable when used in terms of tone systems.
