The Nisenan [niʃnɑn] lived in northern California, between the Sacramento River and Sierra Mountains. The Nevada City Rancheria was created from an executive order by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913 from a land allotment obtained by Chief Charlie Cully in 1887. Cully's land on Cement Hill became Federal Trust Land and the Tribal government became a federally recognized entity (Nevada City Rancheria website, 2021). Historically, the Nisenan was misidentified and mislabeled as “Maidu”, “digger“, and “southern Maidu”, despite their differences in cultures and tradition. I found two different pronunciation of the tribe’s name, [niʃnɑn] and [nisɛn.nɑn], the former is likely correct since it was spoken during an interview with the Tribal council chairman.%0aThere are no Indigenous-run sources that document the number of speakers currently. Third-party researchers state that there were 9000 speakers of Konkow, Maidu, and Nisenan together, and there are no first-language speakers at present (Golla, 2011). There are however quite a few archives related to this language in the California Language Archive, but none are systematic resources for the education of this language. Given the low number of speakers, it is hard to say how the language is used.%0aTwo initiatives are working towards the restoration of Nisenan, the restoration of Nevada City Rancheria, and the California Heritage: Indigenous Research Project. The former looks to restore the federal status of the Nevada City Rancheria, which was terminated by Congress in 1964 along with other California Rancherias. The latter non-profit focused on researching, documenting, preserving, and protecting California Indigenous Nisenan culture.%0aOne difference I found between the first-party and third-party sources is that the Indigenous-run sources focus more on the geographical and historical aspects of the tribe, but with very little mention of the status of the language. In contrast, the third-party sources focus more on documenting the tradition, culture, and present-day status of the language.%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.nisenan.org/%0ahttp://www.nevadacityrancheria.org/%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMJr0txNHKg%0ahttps://cla.berkeley.edu/languages/nisenan.php%0ahttps://cla.berkeley.edu/list.php?langid=564=Nisenan%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisenan#Language%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
