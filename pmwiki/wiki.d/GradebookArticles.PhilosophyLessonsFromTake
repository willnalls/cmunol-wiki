One take on life is to be confident and take what you want in life. So be sure to take that adventure you always wanted to go on, and take on your fears, because life is short. Take love, for example. You can be completely taken with someone and take them to dinner. When you arrive at the restaurant, you help them take off their coat and take their hand as you walk to the table. Well, hopefully that illustrated my point on polysemy – I think it’s time for me to take off now. Bye!%0a%0aThe polysemy and frequent use of the word “take” in the language of the Nacirema reinforces the idea that their society is highly materialistic and focused on individual gain. The word “take” has many meanings, but one of the most frequent uses is when it means to acquire or to gain. People are encouraged to “take” what they want in life, and a model of Nacirema culture is someone who is highly driven to attain the things they want, rising from the lowest societal status and becoming extremely (materially) wealthy. The prevalence of this word suggests also that the welfare of the individual is placed above the welfare of the community in the society of the Nacirema – “taking” rather than “giving” or “contributing” to the collective welfare of the group. %0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema%0a:Essential: {Category.LanguageOfTheNacirema$:essential}%0a:Title: Philosophy Lessons from Take%0a:Author: ShahinC%0a:Section: A%0a:Completed: 20.03.2021 - 20:40%0a:Status: complete%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aThe word Take and its many different meanings%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aWe can TAKE something from somebody else, although it probably would not be the right thing to do, in most cases. However, when you TAKE someone else's hand, it usually implies the expression of love or affection towards that special someone; if that special someone agrees with your expression, that person is now TAKEN. That was obviously a different TAKE on the word TAKE, but you get the point. When arguing with others, be sure to TAKE some of their points while they TAKE yours in order to reach a resolution to the argument. Afterward, be sure to TAKE your blood pressure because after because many studies have shown that arguing is likely to lead to an uptick in blood pressure levels. Now, TAKE the information in this paragraph and run with it. %0a%0aThe Nacirema are certainly forward-thinking in that words have many meanings, making the words very functional. The Nacirema also seem to care quite a bit about possessions and belongings, as the word take can be leveraged in various contexts and can possess a unique connotation in each of those contexts. To take someone's hand can demonstrate affection; however, to take someone else's possessions is clearly wrong.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema%0a:Essential: {Category.LanguageOfTheNacirema$:essential}%0a:Title: Philosophy lessons from "take"%0a:Author: BrandonW%0a:Section: C%0a:Completed: 20.03.2021 - 20:58%0a:Status: complete%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Grading History'''%0a%0a[[#history]]%0a%0a[[#historyend]]%0a%0a%25blue%25 '''Comments for student'''%0a%0a[[#comments]]%0a%0a[[#commentsend]]%0a%0a----%0a----%0a!!%0a%0aSummary: \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aPolysemy of the word "take"%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aYour boss tells you to TAKE a seat and gives you a proposition.
