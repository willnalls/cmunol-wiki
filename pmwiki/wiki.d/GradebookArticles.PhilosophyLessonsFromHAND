Tools can be HANDy. You might need to hold someone’s HAND through a rough experience. You ask someone’s HAND in marriage, and you try your HAND at a novel activity. You can be dealt a good HAND in cards or in life. If you acquire something, you get your HANDs on it. Heavy-HANDed describes something overbearing or overdone.
