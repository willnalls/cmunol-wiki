Why “lazy”? Why "drunken slur"? I believe the word “lazy” here means some syllabi of a word are not pronounced, but the word itself is a great example of discrimination in the wild. “Lazy” is often treated as a negative word, as if it suggests that Australian English is an inferior version of English. But in fact, no! Accent is a convention from historical, geographical and cultural factors, and in terms of orthodoxy, Australian English might be even more “English” than American English. Australian Accent is a result from colonialization. It presents a mix of British accent and English with native language accents. One of the accents that strongly influenced the Australian accent is the Cockney, and as a non-rhotic accent, it is already very different from most of the American accents. Also, as many other British accents, Cockney has “th-fronting” (“/θ/ can become [f] in any environment. [fɪn] "thin", [mɛfs] "maths””) and many other rules that make some syllabi extremely light. Australian accent gets this idea and therefore form pronunciations like “G’day”. %0a%0ahttps://lens.monash.edu/@politics-society/2019/03/13/1373667/oi-were-not-lazy-yarners-so-lets-kill-the-cringe-and-love-our-aussie-accents%0a%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221208-014449-875580#%0a#foxbegin 221208-014451-455700#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!"laziness"  in Australian accent is not a reason for accent discrimination %0a-> - tingchen%0a-> [-07.12.2022 - 17:44-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221208-014451-455700 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think the source cited by the original work is interesting.
