When a language uses all common manners of articulation, it means that there exist words in that language using each of the different consonant sounds.

I would have assumed that the lack of a sound that is commonly used in English would have proved to be a barrier to learning the language. However, based on a document released by the Hawaiian government on their non-English speaking population, this does not seem to be the case - only 0.6325%25 of their population does not speak English. Although newer generations learning English from when they're young and immigrants might heavily affect this, it might also mean that a difference in the set of consonants used might not be a large barrier to learning a language like I initially assumed. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/18A#2/54.8/152.8%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/43%0ahttps://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/economic/data_reports/Non_English_Speaking_Population_in_Hawaii_April_2016.pdf%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
