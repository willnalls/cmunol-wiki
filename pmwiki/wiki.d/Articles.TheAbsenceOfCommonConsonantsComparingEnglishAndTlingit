The language is spoken by the Tlingit people, a tribe indigenous to North America. According to the current leaders of this tribe, the move to write down the language in latin characters and depart from oral-centric tradition was to better engage with foreign governments and people who often sought to remove their sovereignty. While this development is a result of unfortunate circumstances affecting the agency and security of the Tlingit people, it has allowed there to be some linguistic analysis of the language and in fact there is a freely accessible pdf textbook of Tlingit for second language learners (see sources). %0a%0aInterestingly, Tlingit contains no bilabial consonants. Bilabial consonants are sounds made by using both lips, for example, the bilabial consonants [b], [m], and [p] which can be heard in the English words bee, mop, and pat are completely absent from the language. In fact, only 4 languages according to the data accumulated by The World Atlas of Language Structures: Chipewyan, Tlingit, Oneida, and Wichita. Each of these languages originated in North America although they are spread out throughout the continent and do not all originate in the Northwest. In Tlingit, there is little variation in voice onset time between stops at different places of articulation. Voice onset time is the time between a stop consonant and a voiced consonant, and in English and other languages voice onset time is a parameter that varies with the place of articulation but this is not found in Tlingit likely due to the absence of bilabial consonants. This is due to the fact that voice onset time for bilabials tends to be very short compared to alveolars and velars. %0a%0aI find it really interesting that Tlingit alone in its geographic area has no bilabial consonants, particularly given the general ease of producing bilabial sounds and how common they are globally. It makes me wonder what other factors possibly contributed to the absence of bilabials, like long term isolation, etc? %0a%0ahttps://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages/tlingit.php %0ahttps://wals.info/feature/18A#2/20.3/165.5 %0ahttp://www.ccthita.org/about/history/index.html %0ahttps://tlingitlanguage.com/learning-tlingit/tlingit-linguistics/ %0ahttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_dONRvvGz4gQTFyWFVaQ3ltUmM/view %0ahttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/30351941_Aspects_of_the_Phonetics_of_Tlingit %0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/579#tsegments%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)
