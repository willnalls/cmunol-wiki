Most languages, including English, contain consonants that fall under all of these categories. The World Atlas of Linguistic Structure (WALS) tracks this linguistic typology across 567 languages.

It went officially extinct in 2016, when the last native speaker died (2). Unlike English, Wichita has no bilabial consonants (3). Of the five bilabial consonants on the IPA chart, English only uses three of these and Wichita, of course, has none. %0a	%0aBilabials are the least common type of absent consonant– in other words, almost every language has them. Of the 567 languages tracked by WALS, only 5 of them have no bilabials, and all of them come from North America (1). %0a	%0aAn interesting observation about Wichita’s consonants is that most of them are produced in the middle and back of the mouth. Not only does Wichita lack bilabials, it also lacks labiodental and interdental consonants, the three places of articulation in the front of the mouth (4). The farthest forward consonants are alveolar consonants. Some examples of these are the consonants [s], [n], and [t]. However, most of the consonants are formed back in the mouth in the velar and glottal areas, such as [k], [ɦ], and [ʔ]. %0a%0a(1) https://wals.info/chapter/18%0a(2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_language%0a(3) https://wals.info/feature/18A#4/47.72/254.67%0a(4) Stanford Phonology Archive. 2019.
