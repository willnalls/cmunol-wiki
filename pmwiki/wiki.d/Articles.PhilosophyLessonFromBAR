For them, there are only two types of things: those that fit a category, and those who do not. For example, the "Bar" is used to describe the test people have to pass in order to become a lawyer. "Bar" only describes a standard for which people are considered to pass, or not pass, and doesn't take into account if a person did particularly well, very poorly, or very close to the cutoff score. Similarly, the phrase "bar a few" means "except", dividing people into a group that fits a category and another group that does not. The phrase doesn't account for having a gray zone at all. Moreover, even "bars" people drink from can be thought of as a divide because people are either behind the bar or in front of the bar.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210327-143536-690480#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: C:)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)
