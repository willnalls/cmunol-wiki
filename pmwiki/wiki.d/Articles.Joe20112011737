By speaking to one another in their native languages, these Native Americans were able to transmit messages securely and quickly, giving the United States the communications abilities it needed to be able to act effectively in war, and thus played a crucial roll in the United States's involvement in the World Wars.%0a%0aNative American Code Talking as a concept succeeded due to the lack of speakers of native languages abroad, along with the vastly different structure some native languages have in comparison to Eurasian languages. For example, Navajo is the language of the Navajo nation in the Southwestern United States and was used extensively for Code Talking in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The Navajo language has four contrastive vowel qualities [i, e, o, ɑ], along with two contrastive vowel lengths and contrast over nasalization. [1] Additionally, Navajo contains a large number of Tense, Aspect, and Mood variations that are expressed through suffixation and verb stem vowel alternations, most of which are not expressed in European languages in a similar manner. [2] This, along with its tonality, non-European vocabulary, and lack of a written form make Navajo impossible to understand or interpret for people without exposure to the language. %0a%0aCode Talking was first implemented by the United States towards the end of World War I, in which Cherokee and Choctaw peoples communicated via telephone lines in their native languages, which the opposing Germans were unable to decipher. Code Talking was used most extensively however, during World War II, in which members of the Comanche, Hopi, Meskwaki, and Navajo people groups, among others, were enlisted to for communications purposes. While communication security for code talkers was sometimes bolstered by using a substitution cipher in which individual English letters were substituted for words in native languages, it was often sufficient for Code Talkers to speak in their own languages, albeit with substitutions for words for modern military equipment such as "plane" that don't have direct translations. While other, more conventional forms of American encryption were often broken through the war, the native Code Talking remained viable throughout the duration of the war. On the Pacific Front for example, where Navajo code talkers were employed by the United States Marines, the Japanese were never able to figure out the Navajo language despite cracking conventional encryption methods used by the Army and air forces. [3] Unfortunately, despite their brave service the Code Talkers did not receive recognition for their work until 1992, almost 50 years after the end of the war, due to concerns about national security if the technique was to be used again.%0a%0a[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_phonology%0a[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_grammar#Modes,_aspects_and_tenses%0a[3] https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221210-035120-499870#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!The Enigma Machine vs. Code Talkers %0a-> - nbraga%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 19:51-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-035120-499870 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aDuring WW1 and WW2, Code talkers were vastly used as a form of communication by the Americans as mentioned in the article.
