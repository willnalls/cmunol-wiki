Periodt.%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aThe term "periodt" has been all over social media and daily conversation. According to the Urban Dictionary, it is used when someone agrees with a statement, wants to emphasize a point, or wants to compliment someone [1]. For example, one could say, "I just aced my final!" and one would reply, "Periodt!" It is usually applied in informal situations.

First and foremost, it is important to give credit where it is due. "Periodt" originates from African American Vernacular English.

The user, PBCliberal, posted on Twitter, "Churches should pay taxes periodt" [2]. Although it most likely was a typo, the misspelling stuck, and now its presence has made itself more abundant throughout the years. On Instagram, 605,000 posts are under #periodt. On Tik Tok, videos under #periodt have a total of 1.7 billion views. Thus, this word definitely has widespread use. As for its use being sustained, if one were to look up "periodt" on Twitter, they would find tweets dating very recently.
