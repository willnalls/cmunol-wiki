There are six categories for filtering someone’s feed: politics, seriousness, rudeness, gender, brands, and obscurity. When a user selects one of these categories, Gobo will filter it out and tell them why. The writer of this article talks specifically about the rudeness filter, and how when this is turned on, the posts from women of color start to disappear. %0a%0aPosts that were marked as “very rude” were ones like: “You in yo bag sis! You betta do it sis!!!” “You are a dope ass woman”, even though they are objectively positive statements. This shows how machine learning is programmed to discern AAVE automatically as rude. For example, the deletion of the verb “are”, the deletion of the final vowel and diphthong of “you”, the shortening of “better” to “betta” (deletion of the [ɹ] ), and the use of slang like “dope ass” are flagged as rude because they are common features of AAVE. %0a%0aThere is also a feature of the rudeness filter which uses AI to analyze a sentence and determine if it is “toxic” or not. The writer of the article tested a number of sentences out in the app, and it overwhelmingly identified AAVE as toxic. The most toxic among the tested sentences was “I am a gay black woman.” (identified as 87%25 toxic), and the least toxic was “I am a man.” (20%25 toxic). This shows how technology is constantly being used to suppress AAVE and reinforce racism.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
