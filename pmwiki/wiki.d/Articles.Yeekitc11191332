The name of their tribe is derived from words in their traditional language that mean, roughly, “those who live at red earth hole”. They lived under redwoods, among bushes and grasses of a California untouched by drought, and along streams and rivers abundant with fish; they hunted with obsidian-tipped spears and wove baskets with reeds that grew along the Russian River. %0a	In the town I called home for almost nine years, there was a museum that featured seasonal exhibits of work from local artists, but beneath the ever-changing flyers and fronts of the Grace Hudson Museum, the nature of the garden and the buildings themselves, as we all knew, stayed the same. The totem pole in front of the Sun House, a relic from the nineteenth century of a time when California was just getting colonized spoke of the Native Americans to whom the land had originally belonged; as did the gardens, filled with flora and fauna long gone from the wild, but that had sustained the Pomo for generations. It was, then, natural for me to choose their tribe and their language for this assignment. %0a	The Pomo were a vast tribe, with many sub-languages spoken by the many groups of people who belonged to it. Today, there are about seven distinct and recognised groups under the Pomoan family of languages with a multitude of subgroups, which include the Northern Pomo, Central Pomo, and Kashaya. However, contact with European colonizers did throw the languages into jeopardy and sadly, many of them have been lost; however, many groups are actively trying to revive their culture and language across Northern California, the Pomo in the place I grew up being one of them. There are about twelve dialects of Pomo still considered to be live languages now, one of the well-known being the Elem Pomo’s xay tsnu, which is being actively taught by the Clear Lake Pomo Cultural Preservation Foundation. Ukiah High School, the largest high school in the county of Mendocino, also began offering Pomo language as a class in 2020, in an effort to preserve the critically endangered Northern Pomo tongue. %0a	The narrative of the story of the Pomo does not vary too much from the websites I found of the tribes, and of non-Native sources such as Wikipedia. The Pomo, similar to most other Native American tribes, thrived on the land for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans, who stole their culture and traditions from them, bit by bit, until they were living on reservations far from their homeland and forbidden from speaking their languages, or practicing their religions. While the story remains much the same, the details given by different sources are where the information beings to diverge: if I were to have written this based only on non-Native sources, I would have received the impression that the Pomo and their language are something of the past - a myth, or a historical marvel, perhaps. From the “Welcome!” written in capital letters atop the home page of the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians website to the picture of young boys in traditional dress in the background, however, the Native sources paint a wholly different picture. %0a	In their eyes, the Pomo and their languages are far from gone. On the contrary, they are just re-emerging after their forceful suppression, and the hope of the next generation to rediscover their roots has just begun to catch flame.%0a%0aSources%0ahttps://www.hoplandtribe.com/culture-traditions%0ahttps://www.hoplandtribe.com/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Pomo_language%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomo%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)%0a(:Title: The Pomo of Northern California:)
