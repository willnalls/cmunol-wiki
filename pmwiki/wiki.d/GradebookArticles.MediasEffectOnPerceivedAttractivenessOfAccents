This sort of blanket statement is one, that for obvious reasons, causes a lot of uproar.

The reason for this perception of Indian accents is a direct product of media pandering and perpetuation of stereotypes. Media often represents Indians with a caricatured accent. This is often done for some sort of comedic purpose, especially because in mainstream media, the casting of an Indian actor has historically been as a side character meant for comedic relief. %0a%0aFor instance, in the show Jessie on Disney Channel, the character Ravi was made to speak in an overly exaggerated accent. This coupled with other stereotypical behaviors, like being terrible at speaking to people he was attracted to, bad social skills in general, an affinity for school, reptiles and cultural foods, simply associates such an accent with only this narrow-minded, seemingly unattractive view of Indian people. %0a%0aJessie is not the only show to do this. Other Disney shows, like Phineas and Ferb, and other mainstream shows like the Big Bang Theory and The Simpsons often force their token Indian character to don an accent, and then paint them as losers who have no game. %0a%0aThis constant barrage of media associating the Indian accent with characters that are seen as unattractive has conditioned the general public into believing such an accent is inherently unattractive, even those who naturally speak this way. The same phenomenon works in both ways. For example, European accents are often seen as the most attractive, and this is mainly because popular media associates characters who have such accents with desirability (like James Bond). %0a%0aThis linguistic discrimination mainly revolves around the single popularized view of the Indian accent, one that involves a lack of aspirated voiceless plosives, and a non-rhotic accent. I don't believe anything about the structure of the accent itself contributes to this phenomena, but rather attribute it to the media's portrayal and subsequent conditioning of the general public by constantly painting the Indian accent as undesirable. %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
