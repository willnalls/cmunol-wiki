One may refer to their friend as a "lucky DOG" if they encounter good fortune, but a scoundrel may also be referred to as a "dirty DOG". You can be DOGGED by fear of "DOGGING it" on an exam.

Their use of the term as either endearing and pejorative in different circumstances suggests that the wolves can be seen both as companions and as nuisances. Perhaps they have a superstition that bringing wolves into ones own home invites chaos, and thus troublemakers must be banished from the house to live with the wolves until harmony is restored. It is also suggested that the wolves are used for some sort of labor, as the Naciremans associate the livelihoods of the wolves with strife, exhaustion, and discontent. There also seem to be references to wild wolves, likening competition to wolf packs attacking each other, and likening fear to the feeling of being chased by wild wolves. The name of the Nacireman sausage suggests that wolf meat is a principal ingredient, but Naciremans will insist that their sausage is made from other types of meat, citing either their love for wolves, akin to that of their own children, or their disgust for the use of a feral animal, since the medicine men have not declared it to be clean and fitting to eat.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
