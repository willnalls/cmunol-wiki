The Cockney accent she used was considered a lower class accent and less proper than the standard Received Pronunciation or “Queen’s English” accent.%0a%0aSome key elements of her accent that were criticized was the glottal stopping used in words like “where”, “you”, “going” and “better” which are pronounced with a glottal stop, making better into [be?ə] instead of pronouncing the ‘t’ at the alveolar. Another criticized element of her accent was what is known as the “London vowel shift” where “day” is pronounced as [dæɪ] instead of [deɪ]. %0a%0aThis is not really a dialect of English but more of just an accent that is typically centralized around London, specifically the East End. One of the characters in the film, Professor Higgins, believes that accent and tone determines people’s prospects in society. He takes on Eliza and is determined to “fix” her and make her into a “proper lady” showing his disdain for her original Cockney accent and that he didn’t think that she had a chance in “society”. This is a more dated example of linguistic discrimination, but shows how accents were taken to signify a person’s place in society as well as the difficulty to move out of that position because of their accent.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady_(film)%0ahttp://dialectblog.com/british-accents/%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
