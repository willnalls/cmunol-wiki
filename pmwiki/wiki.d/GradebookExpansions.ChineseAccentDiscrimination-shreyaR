In Korean, /l/ and /ɹ/ are represented by the same letter of the alphabet, so when writing words using the Korean alphabet, both of these sounds would be represented by that letter. Therefore, when learning how to pronounce words in English, native Korean speakers might pronounce both sounds the same in all contexts, either using /l/ in place of every /ɹ/ or vice versa, because both would be written the same in their phonetic alphabet (for example, "rake" and "lake" are spelled identically in Hangul). Because there is no distinction between the sounds in Korean, native speakers would not be accustomed to differentiating between them. This may also contribute to a stereotype of East Asians in general not knowing how to differentiate between the two sounds, especially since many Americans are unable to tell the difference between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
