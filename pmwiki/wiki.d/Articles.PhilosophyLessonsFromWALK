You can talk the talk with your words, but may not always be able to WALK the WALK and match your words with your actions.

The variety of uses not only demonstrates a certain movement of the legs to move oneself forward, but also a metaphorical representation of actions and motion in general. This metaphorical usage of the word “walk” in phrases such as “walk the walk” seems to suggest a concern with demonstrations or actions. The Nacirema culture seem to be extremely concerned with actions and the portrayal or reception of such actions by others. Additionally, the Nacirema people seem to often be on the go.
