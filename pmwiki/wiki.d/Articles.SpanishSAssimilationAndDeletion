However, in the second interview the speaker (Puerto Rican) does not pronounce either the ‘s’ in ‘los’ or ‘muchachos.’ Given that these are nearly identical situations, it is clear that /s/-deletion is not the same across dialects, and different dialects have different rules regarding when it can and cannot occur. Furthermore, in this video:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJqhN2L2sd4&t=86s (“todas las pruebas”)%0athe speaker doesn’t pronounce any of the ‘s’ sounds, so the plurality is only given by the context.

The interviewer is from Cuba so I believe that /s/-deletion is a part of her native accent, so it is interesting that during the more “formal” part of the interview she articulates the /s/’s but during the conversation she drops them. While I’m not sure why she specifically chose to do this, I could potentially see this being a form of code switching. %0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210403-005041-274360#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)
