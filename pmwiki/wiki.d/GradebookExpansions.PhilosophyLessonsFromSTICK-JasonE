Many of the definitions of the word stick have to do with not moving or changing an opinion, goal, or action. This shows that the Nacirema society is stubborn and does not like change as it is actively avoided. The Nacirema society is “stuck” in their ways of doing things and have not changed any of their customs or traditions in many years. Any deviation from the normal way of acting or doing a task is shunned by the people of the Nacirema society. This unwillingness to change results in a society that is "stuck" in the past and is unable to catch up to the present. The Nacirema society’s unwillingness to adapt to the changing landscape of the world has left them "stuck" in the glory days of their past. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
