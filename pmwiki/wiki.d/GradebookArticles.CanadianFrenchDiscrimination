Quebecois French is often seen as "improper" French by those outside Canada, and in the past, sometimes by "proper" French speakers inside Canada. However, as Quebec and Quebecois French have grown, and with the creation of "Standard Quebecois French," there is increasing discrimination against both Parisian Francophones and French-speaking Anglophones.

Despite Trudeau's fluency in French, he is often made fun of for not using "proper" Quebecois French.
