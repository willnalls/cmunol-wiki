There are several Sámi languages, including North Sámi, Ume Sámi, and Pite Sámi. They are about as similar to each other as the romance languages are to each other, though languages used in adjacent regions appear to have a reasonable degree of cross-understandability. The reason for the endangerment of Ume Sámi is the marginalization of the Sámi people, who have had a complex historical relationship with the Scandinavians. In the 19th century, the governments of Norway and Sweden, which had largely ignored the Sámi to this point, began policies of forced assimilation. From the 19th century onwards, the Swedish and Norwegian authorities regarded the Sámi as a "primitive" people in need of "civilizing", imposing Scandinavian language on their communities as the only valid language, and banning the Sámi languages in schools. Though the Sámi have gained legal recognition as a minority group, with assimilation policies being ended in the 1970s, and in 2000 a law passed in Sweden guaranteeing the right to use Sámi in dealing with the courts and government agencies, much damage had already been done to the Sámi languages, as many young people in Sámi communities cannot speak Sámi fluently. For Ume Sámi, there are only 10-20 remaining native speakers, and its EGIDS categorization is endangered (EGIDS 6b-9).%0aRevitalization efforts for the Sámi languages are ongoing in Sweden. The government-funded Sámi Language Center, which recruited its staff from the speakers of different Sámi languages, has undertaken various revitalization projects. They started by researching the the different cultural and linguistic needs of the varied population of speakers of Sámi languages in Sweden. They have developed a language learning mentor program, which paired students with older native speakers of the Ume Sami language and encouraged them to meet regularly to use Ume Sámi while doing everyday activities, such as cooking. Additionally, the Language Block program aimed at removing mental and emotional blocks that prevented many Sámi who had acquired the language in childhood from speaking it in their daily lives. This consisted of group meetings for language exercises, along with homework between sessions. Though the Sámi languages may be endangered, there are active and ongoing efforts to increase their usage.%0a%0aSources%0aIndigenous Peoples of the Arctic Council%0ahttps://www.arcticpeoples.com/sagstallamin-the-saami-languages%0a%0aWorld Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples%0ahttps://minorityrights.org/minorities/sami-3/%0a%0aEthnologue%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/size-and-vitality/sju%0a%0aOvercoming Silence and Sorrow: Sami Language Revitalization in Sweden: %0ahttps://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&context=ijhre%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: A:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Ume Sámi:)
