There are often similar comments on any discussion of Harry Kane, and he has in part become identified by his manner of speaking (although he is a very accomplished and talented footballer).%0a%0aJudging from where Kane grew up and what people say about him, Kane appears to speak something similar to Estuary English. It is worth noting that Estuary English is generally considered to be a working class accent and is slightly stigmatized in England. Kane also seems to have his own distinctive speech patterns which make him particularly difficult to understand for an American English speaker such as myself. Kane tends to nasalize most of his sounds, and all of his consonants tend to be pushed further back so there is a much higher frequency of uvular and glottal sounds. For example, he tends to turn the unvoiced alveolar stop [t] into a glottal stop [ʔ] and similarly turning velar stops [k] and [g] into their uvular counterparts [q] and [ɢ] or a glottal stop [ʔ]. His voiced fricatives in particular sometimes sound different (to my ears) because they often turn into the uvular [ʁ]. %0a%0aAlthough his accent is quite different from what we're expected to hear, he should not be thought of as any less for it. The ESPN clip was particularly worrying to see as it showed an example of conflating manner of speaking with other elements of the person.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-041451-188510#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!! %0a-> - AlexX%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAs a fan of Tottenham and Harry Kane himself, I must admit that I myself have in the past laughed at and made jokes about his accent and speech patterns without understanding or giving much thought to the full context behind them, especially the stigmatization of his accent in English society.
