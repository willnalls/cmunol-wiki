The visual nature of the information generally doesn’t affect acquisition compared to auditory and visual learning together when a child learns a spoken language. Although the mechanism of acquisition may be similar between the two cases, however, the ability of a child’s environment to stimulate that mechanism is not. More than 90%25 of deaf children have parents or caregivers who are unable to provide adequate language input required for thorough learning. As a result, deaf children often fall behind in language acquisition metrics compared to their peers who are nearly constantly exposed to audible language input.%0a%0aResearchers are simultaneously interested in addressing such hindrances in language development as a means of harm reduction and studying the effects of this kind of development on other aspects of a child’s life. When it comes to children exposed to naturally occurring sign language in their environment from early on—a situation that by far comprises the minority of cases—milestones of language acquisition are congruent between deaf children and their hearing counterparts (1). In situations of delayed development/exposure, however, meta-analyses have shown that groups of increasingly late sign language exposure (native, 5-7 then 8-13) perform proportionally worse in identifying grammatical inconsistencies in signed phrases. Interestingly, it remains unclear whether or not late acquisition of a sign language necessarily leads to less overall proficiency, or rather more targeted instances of language underdevelopment. This is an interesting question to consider, especially across various sign languages and given the increased usage of slang within them. %0a%0aMore specifically, research has shown that differences in sign language usage between these time-of-acquisition groups are primarily characterized by the different syntactic preferences that these groups exhibit (2). Furthermore, trends in syntactic sensitivity between acquisition groups have been observed across age groups as well, suggesting a lifelong link between when one acquires a sign language and one’s sensitivity to grammatical variations of that language. At the same time, all of this is considered within the context of the various structural and economic obstacles to early-acquisition that are present for a considerable number of sign language learners starting from childhood.%0a%0a(1) Lillo-Martin, Henner. “Acquisition of Sign Languages.” Annual Review of Linguistics. https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-linguistics-043020-092357%0a%0a(2) Krebs, Roehm, Wilbur, Malaia. “Age of sign language acquisition has lifelong effect on syntactic preferences in sign language users.” International journal of behavioral development. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8530180/%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221023-031258-29240#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Sign Language Acquisition of BASL: A Variant of ASL %0a-> - mswendse%0a-> [-22.10.2022 - 20:12-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221023-031258-29240 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAn article from the Washington Post describes a deaf black woman having grown up learning a different type of ASL and being unable to understand sign language coming from a white person (1). This leads to an interesting discussion about BASL and ASL in terms of sign language acquisition since BASL is not slang and is established as its own version of sign language, similar to how BVE is not slang of Standardized American English and is its own version of English. Another article describes the differences between BASL and ASL, as BASL tends to utilize facial expressions more, uses more space when signing, and often uses both hands instead of one (2). In the Washington Post article, the woman describes having to practice code-switching as well, despite being deaf because she had to copy the sign language the white children would do. Historically, sign language acquisition for black people was made difficult because of the lack of funding for deaf schools for black children (1).
