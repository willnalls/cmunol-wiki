Its low count of under 2,000 speakers has caused it to be classified as an endangered language, and a large cause of this low speaker count is due to the people's general isolation from more populated, urban areas. The native speakers - known as Barasanas - live along the Pira Paraná River in Colombia and the banks of the Vaupés River Basin. The language itself belongs to the Eastern branch of the Tucanoan language family, and it has many notable features that distinguish itself from the many similar dialects/languages surrounding it. One such feature is that it maintains a three-portion distinction between spatial and temporal distances. In terms of its phonology, the Barasana alphabet is composed of 11 consonants and 12 vowels, and stress and pitch are important features in the composition of words. An interesting fact about the speakers is that marriages between speakers of Barasana are forbidden. Speakers are instead required to promote multilingualism by marrying speakers of other languages/dialects (even Eduria, a language that shares approximately 98%25 similarities with Barasana). Furthermore, there have not been noticeable efforts to revitalize the language, so its status as an endangered language will likely continue into the future.%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barasana-Eduria_language%0ahttps://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4024%0ahttps://www.ethnologue.com/language/bsn%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Barasana:)
