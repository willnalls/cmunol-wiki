For example, consonant inventories can range from a size of 6 to 122; some languages encode meaning differences with tones, while others do not; some restrict syllables to just a consonant and following vowel, while others allow multiple consonants in a row.  Phonological processes seem to only add to the ways that languages can differ: vowel harmony, nasal assimilation, palatalization, epenthesis, deletion, etc.%0a%0aAnd all this is true! There is an enormous amount of variability in the sounds and sound systems of languages.  Nevertheless, all humans are equipped with the same vocal tract apparatus, and it turns out that many of the phonological phenomena of spoken languages crop up again and again.  For example, homorganic nasal assimilation is a very common process, cross-linguistically.  That is, if a language has consonant clusters, then it is very likely that a sequence of a nasal and following stop will be realized with the same place of articulation.%0a%0aThe goal of this wiki category is for us to build an inventory of examples of phonological phenomena across languages, where a phenomenon is either a phonotactic generalization or a phonological process.  You cannot include types of contrast here (e.g. “Language X uses tone for lexical contrast”) as these are covered in the category Typology of phonetic contrasts.  You may add an example of either a phonotactic restriction, or a phonological process, but you must include 3-5 examples from the language in question to illustrate the phenomenon.  You must name the phenomenon, and identify the language family of the language you’ve chosen; [[https://www.ethnologue.com/|Ethnologue]] is a good source, but you can only access a limited number of page views, so you’re welcome to look up the language on [[https://wals.info/|WALS]] or [[https://phoible.org/|PHOIBLE]].  Here’s an example of the beginning of an entry; particularly for non-English languages, you will want to offset the examples so they are not inline with the paragraph.  Finally, you must describe the articulatory configuration that underlies the process.%0a%0aIt is my hope that as entries are added, you can begin to see patterns of the kinds of phenomena that surface again and again.%0a%0a!!!English voicing assimilation%0aIn English (Indo-European), certain morphemes assimilate in voicing to a preceding consonant, as in the plural morpheme /z/ (written as %3cs> or %3ces>) and the 3rd person possessive /z/ (written as %3c’s>).  Thus we have the words %3ccats> and %3ccat’s> both pronounced as [kæts], since /t/ is voiceless; %3cdogs> and %3cdog’s> are both pronounced as [dɔgz], since /d/ is voiced; and %3chams> and %3cham’s> both pronounced as [hæmz], since /m/ is voiced.  There is a set of words that follows the opposite pattern, where the final consonant of the root word assimilates to the voicing of the plural morpheme: %3cleafs> is pronounced as [livz], and not [lifs] (except in the name of the sport’s team, the “Maple Leafs”). %0a%0aDuring voicing assimilation, the configuration of the vocal folds stays the same over a sequence of consonants.  In the [ts] sequence of a word like [kæts], the vocal folds are abducted from the beginning of the closure of [t], until the end of the word, so that the vocal folds are not vibrating.  In contrast, in a [dz] sequence of a word like [dɔgz], the vocal folds are adducted and vibrate through the entire sequence.%0a%0a%0a!!!Expansions%0a%0aExpansions in this section can be of several types.  Some examples:%0a# [+ You can provide audio/video examples of a process in a language that you speak, with a discussion regarding any patterns you observe (e.g., Do all speakers pronounce the words this way?  Do you agree with this description of the pronunciation of words in your language?) +]%0a# [+ You can determine how the application of a particular phonological process would affect loanwords from other languages.+]%0a# [+ You can find an academic article that discusses the articulation or acoustics of one of the processes, and summarise the key finding as it relates to the phonological process in question.+]%0a%0a----
