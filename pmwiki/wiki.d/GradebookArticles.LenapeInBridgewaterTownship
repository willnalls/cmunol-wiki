The traditional stewards of the land were the Munsee Lenape and the Lenni-Lenape. The Lenape tribe is also called the Delaware tribe, as named by European settlers. There are two main stories as to how this name was formulated. The Lenape believe that they were named the Delaware tribe due to their proximity to the Delaware river and after Lord de la Warr. An alternative explanation is that the Englishmen had a hard time pronouncing the word Lenape and when they finally were able to, the Lenape exclaimed, “Nal në ndëluwèn!”, a phrase meaning “that’s what I said” that ended up transforming into “Delaware.” The Lenape people themselves prefer the name Lenape when speaking with each other. An IPA transcription of the name is: /lə’nɑpe/.%0a%0aThere were multiple treaties that the Europeans asked the Lenape to sign in order to give away their land. The Lenape did not practice land ownership, so they believed they were only lending the land to the Europeans. One primary treaty was the Walking Purchase, where the Lenape granted the Englishmen as much land as they could walk in 1.5 days, which ended up being more than expected because the Englishmen ran rather than walking.%0a%0aI was not able to find enough information on the status of the language from the Indigenous sites, but I found that there exists a Lenape Talking Dictionary with a large amount of vocabulary and recordings of native speakers from as early as the 1920s. The dictionary also contains uses of the words in stories and other literature. In addition, there are many collections of translated words such as animal names, trees, clothing, and other categories available as pedagogical resources. I was also unable to find a statistic about the number of speakers.%0a%0aAs my non-Indigenous source, I chose Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a lot of statistics about the number of current-day Lenape speakers - something that I could not find information on while searching through the Indigenous websites. It also contains seemingly more detailed information. However, it is very likely that a large portion of the information on Wikipedia has been compiled and expressed through a Eurocentric lens rather than an Indigenous one. While some things have been acknowledged, such as the encroachment of European settlers onto native land, the major details and firsthand account has been shifted to favor the Europeans. Moreover, the language used to describe the Lenape traditions is very “other”-ing; it portrays the Lenape as a very separate group with an arcane and unfamiliar culture. One key difference I noticed was the description of the pronunciation of Lenape. The Indigenous-authored site described the pronunciation of Lenape as “lun-NAH-pay,” which I transcribed as /lə‘nɑpe/. However, Wikipedia lists the IPA transcription as /ləˈnɑːpi/. The most notable change is the vowel at the end, which the Indigenous people describe more as an /e/, from my interpretation, while Wikipedia says it is an /i/. If I were to write a summary based only on this source (and other non-Indigenous sources), my understanding of the tribe would definitely be biased and I would not be able to grasp the Lenape culture well. If this source was written by Indigenous people, it would likely include more accurate information, more personal anecdotes, and ways for non-Indigenous people to learn more about and get involved with Indigenous culture and conservation efforts in a respectful way. %0a%0aLinks:%0ahttp://delawaretribe.org/blog/2013/06/26/faqs/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
