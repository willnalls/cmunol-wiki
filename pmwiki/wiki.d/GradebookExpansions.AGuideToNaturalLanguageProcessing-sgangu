Specifically, Professor Lorraine Levin who I had the chance to speak with this semester does work on building language technologies for communities that do not already have them. To do this, she does not just use her knowledge of deep learning and NLP, but a deeper understanding of the phonological, morphological, and syntactical constructions behind the language. This is necessary because we typically don't have enough data to build language technologies using just DL techniques for languages that don't have them in the first place. Linguists have to use their understanding of the language in order to make this possible. This work may allow the speakers of these technologically poor languages to then have much greater access to the wealth of information we have on the internet and media. %0a%0ahttps://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/15368/lorraine-levin%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
