This suggests that there is some inherent link between these two concepts in Nacireman culture. One possible interpretation is the Nacirema people only enjoy or “like” people who share certain similarities to them. Another broader interpretation is that the Nacirema people only enjoy objects or concepts that are similar to what they’ve seen in the past (ie that they’re familiar with). Overall, the polysemy of the word “LIKE” suggests that the Nacirema, in general, avoid outsiders as well as unfamiliar concepts or objects. It might be that they are not open to new people or new experiences. It might even be risky to approach or interact with them.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
