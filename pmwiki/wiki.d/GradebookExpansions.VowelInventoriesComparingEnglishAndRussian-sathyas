One example is the number of constants sounds there are. Russian in particular has only 6 common vowel sounds, however it also has 34 consonant sounds versus English's 24 consonant sounds. In this way, languages such as Russian can still have an equal amount of breadth in sounds. Another example of a way of adding compactness is the using tones. Japanese only has 5 vowel sounds and 17 consonant sounds which is significantly less than the amount of phonemes in both English and Russian, however it can make up for the lack of sounds by using tones. So to summarize, I think that combining total amount of sounds in addition to tones can be a way of measuring how compact a language is.%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000939-533280#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000939-533280#%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
