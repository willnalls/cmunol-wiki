It is part of the Mura language family. The language is currently endangered and has a small speaker population, with estimates of between 250 and 380 speakers. However, most of the speakers speak it monolingually from within their villages and communities; as such, the language is not decreasing in usage, and so it is not actively being revitalized.

For starters, it is very phonologically simple, with only about ten phonemes. Additionally, it is thought that women pronounce certain sounds differently than men, specifically [h] for [s]. Perhaps the most defining feature is the lack of specific quantifiers in the language, such as numerals. The language can even be whistled or hummed.
