In this category, there are several feature values: clicks, which are non-pulmonic consonants meaning that the airstream source and direction is different compared to English sounds; labial-velars, which are consonants that are doubly articulated at the velum and lips; pharyngeals, which are consonants articulated in the pharynx; "th" sounds, which are dental fricatives commonly used in English as θ and ð; and the last few feature values are a combination of the ones mentioned above.%0a%0aThe difference between English and Telugu is that Telugu doesn't use any uncommon consonants while English has the use of "th" sounds.%0a%0aWhen I learned this, I was genuinely surprised because Telugu is the language that my family speaks, so I've heard it my whole life growing up.  However, I know that there are a lot of words that, to me, have a ð sound.  For example, the word "ledu" is a way to say "no", and the "d" is pronounced as voiced dental fricative; the four inventories of Telugu on the PHOIBLE website also confirm that ð isn't a consonant used.  When spelling Telugu words in English, none of them are spelled with "th" but rather with "d".  I feel like it is pretty common for a lot of Indian languages to have this quality, and pronouncing these words with a "d" makes it sound very Americanized.  I'm not sure if this discrepancy is due to an error I made while growing up and trying to mimic and learn the language, but this is interesting to me and I'd like to learn more about spelling words from other languages in English. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/linguistics/world-sounds/consonants-non-pulmonic/%0ahttps://phoible.org/languages/telu1262%0ahttps://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_tel%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)
