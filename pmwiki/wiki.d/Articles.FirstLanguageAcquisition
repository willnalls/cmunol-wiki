Adults adapt it naturally to the development of the child, usually staying just one step ahead of the child's development (ie making nonsensical sounds before the child has begun doing so) and simplifying language to a level they can understand (ie exaggerating sound contrasts).%0a%0aUnsurprisingly, research demonstrates a strong correlation between time adults spend speaking to a child and the rate of that child's language development. More interestingly, two-way conversation (where the child is given the opportunity to respond) is approximately six times more effective at improving a child's language development than one-way conversation (adult monologues). Some parenting books recommend parents begin asking their child questions (and pausing before answering it themselves) before the child is able to respond in order to simulate a two-way conversation before it is possible.%0a%0aThere is substantial research showing that young children who watch a lot of television acquire language at a slower rate than others. However, when controlling for the amount of time children spend in direct conversation with adults, there is no effect. In other words, children do not develop language any faster or slower when they watch tv, but they will develop it much slower if tv is used as a substitute for other interactions, possibly because it is impossible for television to adapt to the exact level of a child's development, like an adult can, or to engage them to the same degree as two-way conversation.%0a%0aUnfortunately, most of the research related to children's development of language has occurred on babies learning to speak English and other European languages. One of the open questions in this field of research is how language acquisition is similar and different in languages with vastly different phonetic and morphosyntactic structures.%0a%0ahttps://www.parentingscience.com/effects-of-television-on-children-learning-speech.html#:~:text=Studies%2520report%2520a%2520link%2520between,slowly%2520they%2520learn%2520to%2520talk.&text=TV%2520is%2520linked%2520with%2520slower,time%2520between%2520babies%2520and%2520adults.%0a%0ahttps://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/faq-how-do-we-learn-language#:~:text=Children%2520acquire%2520language%2520through%2520interaction,but%2520also%2520with%2520other%2520children.&text=This%2520'baby%2520talk'%2520has%2520simpler,lots%2520of%2520repetition%2520and%2520questions.%0a%0ahttps://knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2020/how-babies-learn-language%0a%0aWhat to Expect the Toddler Years by Arlene Eisenberg and Heidi Murkoff%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210424-044523-735720#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Babies' Rate of Learning Languages %0a-> - nithyas%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think it's interesting that watching TV has no effect on the rate of language acquisition in babies, and can even decrease the rate of language acquisition when used in place of 2-way interactions, as you mention.

In writing (which we don't learn until our later years), there are clean breaks to words shown through spaces. In speech, we often do not have this, with words running together or variable lengths of pauses between words. How do babies learn to tell these spaces between words and learn individual words? Although this may sound wild, babies tend to learn language due to their sensitivity in the statistical probabilities in our speech as we talk to them. %0aIn language, each word uses syllables in a particular order. Usually, the order of a syllable within a word is much more likely to occur than the order of syllables between words. This probability of the next syllable occurring after the given syllable is called transitional probability, and although babies are not doing any specific statistical work, they pay attention to the likelihoods of when syllables occur to determine when an individual word is said. So, if the transitional probability is low, this indicates a break in a word, as often the syllables we end words with will not be part of the same word. Conversely, if the transitional probability is high, this indicates the syllables are within the same word.%0aAs the original poster said, first language acquisition is confusing and still ambiguous. However, by looking at these properties of statistical learning, we can explain how babies learn to tell words apart and learn single units of words from the confusing speech signal. %0aReference:%0ahttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112001/%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210425-235652-864140#%0a#foxbegin 210504-132637-578580#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Expansion on languages with different phonetics and morphosyntactic structure to English %0a-> - Spencer_L%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think the overall statement of language learning by babies through conversations cannot be extended a little to include the environment we are in most of the time. Having been raised by parents with different language backgrounds, the argument about conversations as an effective tool for babies to learn languages should mean that I would be at least verbally fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. This is not the case, I cannot speak a single word in Cantonese and have semi-fluency in day to day conversations in Mandarin. I am obviously fluent in English, as I was raised in the US and attended school where English was the primary language. Even at a young age, I was exposed to both Cantonese and Mandarin. This would include programs specifically made for language learning and even everyday conversations with family members. However, I spoke English most of the time, due to the fact that most of my days were spent at school. Now at the age of 19, I found myself to be verbally lacking in both. I would agree that most of sounds/voices we hear in our childhood is from our parents, but I would argue that this claim made can be extended with still the overall environment we are raised. Having been away from my parents for a whole semester, I struggled to converse in Mandarin with my parents when I came back for winter break. This resulted in me using English instead. My decrease in Mandarin skills stems from the fact that I was not able to use the language regularly, thus losing a lot of confidence in behavioral familiarity with the language.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210504-132637-578580#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a#foxbegin 210507-224302-783960#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-07.05.2021 - 15:43-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210507-224302-783960 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!Connor_G%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a''''''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aIf you're interested in learning stuff like this, check out 85-102 Introduction to Psychology! %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210507-224302-783960#%0a#foxbegin 210507-023413-934090#%0a(:div1 class=messagehead:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a[-06.05.2021 - 19:34-] &nbsp; %0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c%0a{[foxdelrange button 210507-023413-934090 {$FullName} ]}%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:if1end:)%0a!!!!!AlexanderW%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0a'''Effect of Age'''%0a>>messageitem%3c%3c%0aI mentioned somewhere else how age affects language learning capabilities.
