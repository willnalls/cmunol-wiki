However, there are some exceptions to this rule, one of which that comes to mind is Nikkie de Jager from the YouTube channel NikkieTutorials. I had always thought that she was a native English speaker, but going back to her videos from when she was around 18 years old, I was surprised to find that she had a distinct Dutch accent, and in fact had lived in the Netherlands her entire life. My question is then, are there any common factors that help some adults achieve native or near-native pronunciation? Does the later into adulthood that you learn a language affect your accent? Does pronunciation naturally improve with time for all non-native speakers of a language? Do adults reach a limit past which they won't be able to improve their accent? As someone currently learning a new language I always wonder what steps I can take to effectively improve my accent while still managing my expectations for how accurate my pronunciation will become. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----
