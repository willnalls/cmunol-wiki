There are a total of 13 consonant phonemes in the Narragansett language. The size is also quite small compared to other languages in the world. However, there is a contrast between [t] and its palatalized variant [tʲ], which most other languages don’t have. There are three tones, a high tone, low tone, and a rising-falling tone in the Narragansett language. On top of the tones is a rather complicated stress system. Just like Ojibway, another indigenous Indian Language, all long vowels are stressed, and all alternate even-numbered short vowels are stressed.%0a%0aThe Narragansett language is a highly inflectional language. There are five modes (indicative, infinitives, imperative, subjunctive, interrogative) and three tenses (presentation/past/future). Nouns have two genders: inanimate and animate which trigger verb-noun agreement. The morphological processes of the Narragansett language mainly consist of affixation. For instance, the rules for forming relations "my ___," "your ____," "his/her___," etc. are adding prefixes such as n-, k-, w-, ∞-, etc. The language also differentiate inclusive and exclusive we. To pluralize a noun, the suffix –og or -onk is added to a single noun (and sometimes “reduced vowels” [ə]  or “glides” are required before inserting –og). The suffix –unk pluralizes a collective noun (e.g., all fathers). There is also a diminutive form by adding the suffix -s, as well as an absentative form which refers to nouns relating to deceased persons. This is achieved by adding -I, -oh. Or -uk.%0a%0aSources: http://www.bigorrin.org/waabu2.htm%0ahttps://archive.mpi.nl/tla/islandora/object/tla%253A1839_00_0000_0000_0003_A5F8_B%0ahttps://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED506061%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
