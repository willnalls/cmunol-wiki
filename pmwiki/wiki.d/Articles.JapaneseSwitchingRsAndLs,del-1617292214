The Japanese language does not include the [ɹ] or [l] sounds, but includes the [ɾ] which is almost closer to the English [l] sound than the [ɹ] sound. Because the [ɹ] sound isn’t included in the Japenese language, it makes it difficult for them to hear and produce the sound.

People poke fun at the way they pronounce English words because it sounds different than what we are used to, but I think people forget how hard it is to pronounce sounds that are foreign to your own language. I know there is a similar joke about how non native Japanese speakers pronounce the phrase “only speed is unbreakable” that is popular in Kung Fu movies. In Japanese it is pronounced like “wai faai bat po”, but English speakers say the first two words like “wifi”. This is a joke then that the wifi is super good because of the mispronunciation. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzMUs3badc%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: B:)%0a(:Category: PhonologicalPhenomenaInSpokenLanguages:)
