It contains many different communities, large and small, with varying amounts of cross-pollination between them. Because every user has an opportunity to contribute and be seen by every other user, words can evolve rapidly from a sifting phenomenon, where the most popular usages of images, emojis, and memes propagate and are reused until they become synonymous with the image. Language tends to transmit horizontally in internet mediums, meaning that most transmission occurs within a single generation. This is just due to the fact that most internet communities consist of fairly similar groups and generations - Facebook tends to be more used by Generation X, Instagram is used by more Millenials, while Snapchat and TikTok are primarily used by Generation Z. %0a%0aOf course, this rapid evolution also means language tends to become obsolete or unused relatively quickly. There are now 3053 emojis in usage, up from the original 176: some meaning has to have been lost from those original usages. Some words persist over others though - things like Youtuber or YOLO are still used commonly, even entered into dictionaries. It will be an interesting investigation for linguists of the future, as internet slang, unlike many other previous languages, has many documented and saved archives.%0a%0aMany internet languages make use of emojis and pictorial language, which is much more universal and has some meaning already sorted into it. If I type the emoji 😂, many cultural groups would be able to identify humor or laughing. Different emojis do have specific meanings separate from the original usage that have evolved in communities. For example, if I were to use the emojis 💕🌿🤩💕✨🤭💫 together in a sentence, you might normally think it was trying to be cute , soft, or gentle. However, the original context for these emojis was this sentence from TikTok: “Hey you dropped your crown!💕🌿 dont pick it up 🤩💕✨🤭💫.” %0aThese emojis are often used in excess to convey sarcasm while insulting somebody, playing off of the opposite original meaning of being soft.%0a%0aAnother interesting topic is to see how the segmentation of emoji languages evolves in the future. On platforms like Twitch and Discord, individual communities can create their own emotes. Unlike emojis, which are somewhat standardized in typed text across platforms, these uses are closer to emoticons, which are user-created images (i.e :-) ). For example, someone who did not watch Twitch would probably not understand why Senator Warnock tweeted that gaming with Senator Ossof was “Poggers” (referring to a third-party add-on emote for Twitch). Someone who was not part of a specific twitch community would not understand that the emote “jphCoggers” connotes having a realization or solving a puzzle. In this way, many users of the internet speak different languages depending on which part of the internet they are in, and these communities have much more control over language than in larger platforms, to the point that a single dedicated user could create some meaning with an emote. %0a%0aSources/Further Reading:%0ahttps://www.vice.com/en/article/7kpngb/gen-z-young-people-use-emojis-differently-than-millennials%0ahttps://www.postbeyond.com/social-media-generations-2/%0ahttps://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/meaning-without-words-an-emoji-revolution-aadb4bc0266c%0ahttps://netsanity.net/parents-guide-emojis/#:~:text=The%2520emoji%2520language%2520is%2520nothing,a%2520nearly%2520complete%2520mode%2520of%0ahttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/how-new-emoji-are-changing-pictorial-language/582400/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji%0ahttps://twitter.com/reverendwarnock/status/1341911554007175170?lang=en%0ahttps://twitchemotes.com/channels/112295341%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210507-154401-239410#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Emoji Syntax %0a-> - roochis%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI recently read this experiment on emoji syntax.
