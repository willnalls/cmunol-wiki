The reason it is grammatical is because it uses the double use of the past perfect. The two “had had” play different roles in the sentence and can be combined to create the sentence above. The first use of the double had is the modifier and the second use of the double had is the main verb.

It three distinct interpretations of the word "buffalo":%0a%3c %0a%3c *"Buffalo" (proper noun), a city in New York state%0a%3c *"to buffalo" (verb), an uncommon synonym to "to bully or harass"%0a%3c *"buffalo" (noun), the bovine animal also known as bison%0a%3c %0a%3c While the resulting sentence seems syntactically ambiguous and pretty outrageous, it is grammatically correct and can be expanded to mean:%0a%3c %0a%3c "Bison from Buffalo that other bison from Buffalo bully also bully bison from Buffalo."%0a%3c %0a%3c More outrageously, according to philosopher Thomas Tymoczko, any sentence consisting solely of any number of repetitions of the word "buffalo" can be considered grammatically correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c For more examples of sentences that take advantage of lexical ambiguity in English, see:%0a%3c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWbzjGIec20%0a%3c %0a%3c Source:%0a%3c https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#contentends]]%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expansions:%0a%3c [[#expansions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#expansionsend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:else:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:ifend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Comments%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:section: D:)%0a%3c (:Category: Varia:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
