I am sitting at a TABLE now, writing this paragraph, and yet for my recent lab report I also was required to compile many TABLEs of data. In the wake of submitting that lab report, I find myself wondering often what one of my lab mates brings to the TABLE. In a recent board meeting I attended, one of the members TABLEd an amendment to our constitution. However, as we were almost out of time, the President TABLEd the amendment until our next meeting. Afterwards, I went out with one of my friends who by midnight was under the TABLE and needed to be taken home. She was upset about one of her classes, but after this last exam I bet the TABLEs will turn in her favor. %0a%0aThe Nacirema people seem to hold great store by the invention of the table. A multi purposeful raised flat surface that is used as a place to eat, work, and gather, the name itself has been used in many different contexts to describe multiple aspects of life. For example, in order to indicate that someone brings great skill or experience to a situation, event, or group of people, that person is “bringing something to the table”. If someone’s fortunes are reversed, the phrase commonly used is: “the tables are turning”. A further question that must be investigated is the origin of this phrase, are the tables physically turned in order to reverse bad luck? Finally, these people seem to be drunkards as they commonly overindulge in alcoholic beverages, leading to the phrase “under the table” commonly used to describe a person who is very inebriated. Many more uses of the word table abound, leading this journalist to believe that the table is a revolutionary invention central focus of life in Nacirema culture. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210320-213740-79350#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Alternate interpretation of "Table" %0a-> - abbyl%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aAn alternate way to consider how the word "table" reflects Nacireman society is that the Nacirema seem to be focused on statistics and measurement.
