Baraba Tatar, specifically, is a dialect of Tatar spoken by the Baraba Tatars from “southwestern Siberia east of the Ural Mountains and north of Kazakhstan” (3). The main factor that caused the decline of this language is Russian control of Siberia. While the Tatars maintained their own cultural identity and continued to learn and speak Tatar, Baraba Tatar is not at all taught in schools, and can only be passed on in other ways (1). However, other forms of Tatar are sometimes taught in schools, so Baraba is a dialect that is mostly spoken among older generations of Baraba Tatars and less among the younger (1). Also, in 2017, “the parliament of the Republic of Tatarstan abolished the compulsory study of the Tatar language in schools” (5), which further limited the outreach of the Tatar language as a whole. Due to the fact that the spread of the language has become so limited, Baraba Tatar is classified as “critically endangered” and currently has less than 8,000 native speakers across the globe (4). There aren’t any active revitalization efforts for Baraba Tatar specifically, but there are revitalization efforts for Siberian Tatar (5). %0a%0a1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Tatar_language%0a2) https://theculturetrip.com/europe/russia/articles/will-the-tatar-language-become-extinct/%0a3) https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/print/21082/RS%0a4) https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1123 %0a5) https://globalvoices.org/2021/09/03/is-a-revival-of-tatar-selfhood-possible-despite-russias-identity-politics/ %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221208-032458-560840#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Baraba Tartar grammar %0a-> - haridesikan%0a-> [-07.12.2022 - 19:24-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221208-032458-560840 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aBaraba Tartar has interesting characteristics.%0aIt has 10 vowel phonemes and 3 borrowed from Russian.
