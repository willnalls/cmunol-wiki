The main use of 'done' is to signify a completed past even, like "I done already ate there' or 'He done that chore yesterday' (Note, the combination of the perfective 'done' with the time adverbs suggest that the action has already been completed in the past). The perfective 'done' can be done in many more ways though, usually with event-related, or eventive, verbs (I done called you). It can also be used with negation like 'didn't' (I didn't done that yet). Overall, perfective done is used in 4 main ways, like the perfect result (similar to recent past, an event that just occurred but may still be occuring), existential perfect (an event or thought that occurred at least once), recent past (a recently concluded event), and universal perfect (an event or condition that has continued for a long period).%0a%0aA good distinction between the southern perfective done and the AAE perfective done is that the southern perfective done also use it after 'to-be' verbs, while this does not traditionally happen in the AAE dialect (I'm done tired now).%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/perfective-done#who-says-this%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210329-180127-827160#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Perfective Done Historically Seen as Marker of Class %0a-> - AlexisA%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI found this really interesting, so I did some extra research (primarily at https://books.google.com/books?id=OqUBUgW_Ax8C&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=perfective+done&source=bl&ots=wbTjJ79RdP&sig=ACfU3U3I14iqazzKpvrU1J82-vHEnvNDXQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiOzumpiNbvAhUQVd8KHfEVDVQQ6AEwDHoECBgQAw#v=onepage&q=perfective%2520done&f=false - page 287-288) and found that at least one scholar considered the perfective done to be a mark of the working class as recently as the late 1970s.
