The study interviewed multiple participants while also looking at relevant sociodemographic factors to identify and qualitatively describe discrimination of non-white individuals with African Accents in the workplace. The study found that those who learned English as a second language with an African accent were perceived and misclassified into harmful migrant and refugee stereotypes. This led to the creation of the term “forever migrant”, to describe the forced identity of those who spoke a variety of West-African accented English. One specific linguistic feature that many participants commented on was difficulties in distinguishing whether a sentence or phrase exhibited compositional or non-compositional meaning. An example of this occurred when a participant described how their manager and coworkers did not want to continue their training for their use of work computers, as the participant struggled to understand what their manager meant by the phrase "open the computer." This led to instances of frustration or discrimination with native-speakers, and in one instance bias in work performance evaluations. %0a%0a%0ahttps://scarab.bates.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1442&context=honorstheses%0ahttps://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2022/11/18/accent-discrimination-is-still-a-pervasive-issue-in-the-workplace-research-finds/?sh=523eb377697e%0ahttps://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210528-the-pervasive-problem-of-linguistic-racism%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-214515-988770#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Trust & Accents %0a-> - pwchan%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 13:45-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-214515-988770 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0ahttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brain-doubts-accent/%0a%0aThe above article provides a bit of insight as to why workplace discrimination toward those with accents occurs.
