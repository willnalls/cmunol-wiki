The name Potawatomi also sounds familiar, potentially from Naper Settlement, a history museum in my area.%0a%0aThe indigenous people surrounding the Lake Michigan area were the Potawatomi. Potawatomi translates to roughly to "People of the Place of Fire," however the Potawatomi refer to themselves as nIshnabe'k or "The People". The website native-land.ca refers to the tribe as the Bodéwadmiké, however it seems that Potawatomi is more commonly used to refer to the people of the tribe, and Bodwéwadmimwen is the name of their language. The IPA transcriptions of Potawatomi is as follows: /.pɒtəˈwɒtəmi/%0a%0aThe tribal villages began being displaced from their native land around the end of the 18th century. A series of treaties starting in 1789 caused the tribes 89 million acres of land to slowly dwindle. Potawatomi landholdings were continued to be reduced by the federal government, as they were moved to smaller reserves in Iowa, Missouri, and then Kansas. The culmination of these treaties was in 1861 when the remaining Potawatomi in Kansas were required to adopt U.S. citizenship. The resulted in the formation of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation and the eventual relocation the Indian reservations in Oklahoma which stands today.%0a%0aThe Bodwéwadmimwe‪n was denied during assimilation so the number of speakers decreased greatly‬. Currently there are less than 100 speakers who are located in Ontario and north-central US. Attempts at revitalizing the language are ongoing. I could not find information regarding the extend of the revitalization process. There are a few main resources to learn Bodwéwadmimwen. The Citizen Potawatomi Nation Language department offers online classes at various skill levels. Another resource is the book "Intro to Bodwéwadmimwe‪n‬" by Corrine Kasper found on Apple Books. There are also various other web resources to learn the language. %0a%0aAs stated earlier, there are fewer than 100 Bodwéwadmimwen speakers however it is a Algonquian sub-language. The population of Algonquian speakers is larger at 3330.%0a%0aAs an additional resource, I am using the wikipedia article on the Potawatomi Tribe. From this article, I am able to obtain more information on the specific treaties implemented during assimilation than from the Native website resources. They reference specific treaties such as the Second Treaty of Prairie due Chien, Treaty of Chicago, Treaty of Paris etc. to describe to more accurately describe the result of these treaties. It also seems to provide more accuracy regarding geography. The information on Wikipedia seems to focus primarily on objective factual information. In contrast, the sources linked on native-land.ca have a greater emphasis on cultural aspects and language, following a more story telling tone. One key difference that I preferred in the OSU article was the vast amount of pictures used. These were invaluable in depicting native clothing and texts.%0a%0aResources:%0ahttps://native-land.ca/%0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/potawatomi.htm%0ahttps://www.potawatomi.org/%0ahttps://americanindianstudies.osu.edu/sites/americanindianstudies.osu.edu/files/Pokagon%2520website%25202015%2520final_0.pdf%0ahttps://project.geo.msu.edu/geogmich/potawatomi.html%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210506-031113-376850#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Modern Potawatomi Art %0a-> - saumyaB%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aWhen looking for artwork of the tribe, I initially intended to find older pieces of art that were made by tribe members.

Early Potawatomi art involved textile work such as rush mats, woven bags, and quills, which were often sold to European settlers.
