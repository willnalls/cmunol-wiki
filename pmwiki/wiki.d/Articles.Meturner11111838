The aspects of ASL that do not involve the hands are called non-manual, and are just as important for an ASL learner as the gestures themselves. In many cases, changing the facial expression that accompanies a sign can modify or completely change the meaning. %0a%0aIntricacies of meaning that, in spoken English, are conveyed mostly through inflection, are carried by ASL users in their facial expressions. In the CBC article linked below about “Seen and Heard,” for example, the sign for ‘incredible’ can mean ‘awful,’ ‘shocking,’ ‘amazing,’ or ‘impressive,’ based on the signer’s facial expression and attitude. %0a%0aOther examples of this concept include raised eyebrows to indicate a yes-or-no question, different expressions to convey diminution or emphasis of a certain trait (ex. ‘A little angry’ as opposed to ‘furious’), or shaking the head to indicate an opposite meaning (as in ‘not hungry’). There are also signs whose hand gestures are nearly identical and which are distinguished only by facial expression, such as “rolling on the floor laughing” and “seizure,” as mentioned in the third linked article. This differentiation of definition is certainly stark, and illustrates how important the expression is to the communication of meaning. %0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://www.cbc.ca/arts/it-s-called-sign-language-but-facial-expressions-are-super-important-too-1.4952771%0ahttps://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/facialexpressions.htm%0ahttps://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/facial-expressions-if-you-are-not-using.htm%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221112-221501-378150#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Parallels to spoken language %0a-> - ejwang2%0a-> [-12.11.2022 - 14:15-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221112-221501-378150 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aInteresting observation that inflection in spoken language is the analog of facial expressions in signed language.
