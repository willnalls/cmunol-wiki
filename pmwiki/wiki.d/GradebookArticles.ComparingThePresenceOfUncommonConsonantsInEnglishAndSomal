However, this doesn’t mean they use the same consonants, and in fact, they both have the presence of different uncommon consonants in their language. English has both “th” sounds while Somali doesn’t. Conversely, Somali uses pharyngeal consonants while English doesn’t. %0a%0aThe consonants /θ / and /ɚ /  are the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives. This means that they are consonants formed by partially obstructing airflow, and they are produced by the tip of the tongue touching the teeth. According to WALS, only about 43 out of the 567 reported languages ( %3c 10%25), including English, uses this uncommon consonant. On the other hands, the consonants / ʕ/ and / ħ/ are pharyngeal fricatives. Like dental fricatives, these consonants are produced by the partial obstruction of airflow. However, they are primarily articulated by the constriction of the pharynx. WALS reports that only 24 out of 567 reported languages ( %3c5%25) are pharyngeal. Interestingly, pharyngeal languages, like Somali, are primarily found in three regions: the middle east and north africa, the caucus, and around british columbia. Dental sounds are commonly found in Indo-European languages. %0a%0aAfter researching both of these languages, I found it interesting how the presence of these uncommon consonants seem to transcend geography and are found all over the world. One question I have is how are these specific sounds acquired in different languages? I also wonder at what period in time did these consonant sounds first begin appearing in their respective languages. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/2176#tipa%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/127#tipa %0ahttps://wals.info/feature/19A#2/19.5/152.8 %0ahttps://wals.info/feature/1A#2/19.3/152.8 %0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_consonant %0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
