One example they give is that you can ask the AI to generate images of an armchair in the shape of an avocado and it will produce many realistic looking images of chairs that look like avocados.

The example they gave was a neuron which responded to pictures of people in spiderman costumes, drawn comics of spiderman, and images of the word spider. This demonstrates that the model has some understanding of that entity as a whole. Moreover neuroscientists have also discovered neurons but this time in human brains which respond strongly to a particular object whether in text or image form. The AI shares this common features with the human brain which suggests some understanding beyond just a lookup table.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a#foxbegin 210512-000938-343410#%0a!!Backup interface%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeExpansion:)%0a#foxend 210512-000938-343410#
