Lot’s of good memories of the beach, going out on my grandpa’s boat, and eating fresh seafood. I also have a broad interest in history, and there’s a lot of interesting (albeit tragic) history pertaining to the Wampanoag since they actually occupied the region where the Mayflower and other puritan ships landed.

The ipa transcription of their name would be [wɑmpənɔːɡ] They occupied most of the region now called Cape Cod. There were once 69 tribes in what was called the Wampanoag Nation, but only 3 survive, with the Mashpee Wampanoag being the largest.%0aThe Wampanoag were recognized federally as a tribe and had their own reservation until an unfortunate treaty in 1870 passed by the Massachusetts legislature that stripped them of almost all their land, creating the town of Mashpee, against the will of even the federal government. Up until this point, they were one of the only tribes in the Eastern US still in possession of any land. Fortunately, in 2007, the Mashpee Wampanoag won a court case and actually regained federal recognition as a tribe, allowing them to again acquire land and establish a reservation. (All information thus far comes from the many tabs on the Mashpee Wampanoag Website.)%0aI can’t find great information from Wampanoag websites on the usage of the language outside of this one. It talks mainly of reclamation efforts though, not how it is used currently nor to by how many people. I would hesitantly infer though, based on what I’ve read, that it is used very sparingly currently and few, if any, are fluent, but that there are efforts to change that.%0a%0aLooking at non Indigenous-run websites, it appears information on the various treaties and their impact on the Wampanoag now is lacking; information on their culture is far more surface-level; and information on their politics, initiatives, etc. is also sub-par.
