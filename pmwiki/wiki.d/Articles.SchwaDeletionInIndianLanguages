Some of these languages feature the phenomenon of schwa deletion, where an implicit schwa (pronounced as /ə/ or /ɐ/) present in the Sanskrit root word and written script is not pronounced. An example language that heavily features this phenomenon is Hindi. A language that features only some aspects of schwa deletion is Marathi. %0a%0aThe a religious text "Veda" is spelled as वेद in Hindi, Marathi, and Sanskrit, but is pronounced differently:%0aSanskrit: [ʋedɐ]%0aMarathi: [ʋed]  (deleted schwa)%0aHindi: [ʋed]    (deleted schwa)%0a%0aWord final schwas seem to be deleted more often than medial ones in languages such as Marathi. Hindi tends delete schwas about 89%25 of the time when in an environment like VC_CV. %0a%0aThe word रचना has the same spelling and meaning in all 3 languages, but has different pronunciations: %0aSanskrit: [rətʃənaː]%0aMarathi: [rətʃənaː]%0aHindi: [rətʃnaː] (2nd schwa deleted)%0a%0aIn the US, many people debated how to pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris' first name, and part of the problem comes with Schwa deletion. In Hindi it would be pronounced [kəmlɐ]. But in Sanskrit or Tamil (her mother's native language) it is [kəməlɐ]. Her official pronunciation is based on this second form [kɑːmələ].%0a%0aInterestingly, the phenomenon seems to be changing Marathi. Due to high contact with languages such as Hindi, there has been an increase of schwa deletion in Marathi as well. I have seen this change in my own family, who all speak the language.%0a%0aThe words गुण and गोड were pronounced as [guɳə] and [goɖə] by people in my great-grandparents' generation and are pronounced as [guɳ] and [goɖ] now. The road my grandparents live on has the word मार्ग in its name. This is pronounced as [maɾɡə] by my grandparents, but more like [maɾɡ] (as it is in Hindi) by their younger neighbors. %0a%0aOne possible reason for this phenomenon is talking quickly. English (another Indo-European language) seems to feature some schwa deletion today as well. In these examples, the schwa before a stressless syllable is deleted if the word is said too quickly or in a sentence. %0a%0aOpera: [ɑpəɹə] -> [ɑpɹə]%0aGeneral:[d͡ʒɛnəɹəl] -> [d͡ʒɛnɹəl%0aChocolate: [t͡ʃɔkəlɪt] -> [t͡ʃɔklɪt]%0a%0aIn English schwa deletion does not occur word initially or finally, but may occur in the middle of a word.%0a%0aSources: %0ahttp://www.aellk.or.kr/datax/thesis/1613433509823.pdf%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa_deletion_in_Indo-Aryan_languages%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210330-222205-194770#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!An algorithmic approach to predicting schwa deletion %0a-> - aryans%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aResearchers in the Computer Science Department of IIT Kharagpur created an algorithm that, when given the written form of a Hindi word, predicts where the schwas will be deleted with 96.12 percent accuracy (tested on over 11000 words).
