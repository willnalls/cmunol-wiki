She also explains that she has faced discrimination and judgement in job interviews for her accent, as employers expected her to have a more ‘posh’ accent based on her resume.

H-dropping is common in this dialect in which [h] in words are deleted. Also, deletion of final stops and fricatives in words is not uncommon.

For example [əʊ] is often replaced with the monophthong [ɔː] or [o:], and [ɛ] is sometimes replaced with [ə:]. Additionally, when a closed vowel comes before /l/, a schwa is inserted. These are just a few of the examples of the ‘ungrammatical’ structures associated with Yorkshire accents that led to accentism, especially in academic and professional settings.%0a%0aSources: https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpdn7/accent-bias-job-discrimination-uk%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_dialect#Pronunciation%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
