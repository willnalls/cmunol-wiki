According to Yale's Grammatical Diversity project, "You do you is a construction wherein a personal pronoun or proper name appears as the subject of a form of do followed by the direct-object version of the original pronoun or name" The phrase came to light in the early 2000s, supposedly shortening the phrase “You do you, and I’ll do me.” Moreover, while the phrase is meant to express the same pronoun (you) after ‘do’, it is observed that the second you is not reflexive, and so the phrase “You do yourself” holds an entirely different meaning, making it unique. It is also worth noting that the ‘do’ in the phrase can be inflected to while retaining the same meaning implied by the phrase. As the Yale project points out, the phrase “I’m doing me” holds a similar meaning even with the added suffix -ing to ‘do.’ There are of course, variations of this phrase that hold the same meaning just with the pronouns changed a bit. Ultimately, the phrase is meant to encourage authenticity of one’s self and to be confident in one’s own skin and the decisions that they make. %0a%0aSource: http://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/you-do-you%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: A:)%0a(:Category: MorphosyntacticDiversity:)
