Null copula is commonly seen in African American English and other varieties of English that have had high contact with other languages. This is because many other languages often have null copulas in the present tense. For example, in the sentence “They are happy”, a version displaying null copula would be “They happy”. Null copula is mainly seen in the present tense, that is, “is” and “are”. There are also some exceptions where null copula can’t occur, for instance clause-final positions for the form of “be”. Additionally, there is an interesting relationship between occurrences of null copula in AAE and Standardized American English: deletion of “is” or “are” in AAE occurs if and only if Standardized American English could contract the verb. Because of this relationship with contraction, some argue that null copula is a result of phonological processes.%0a%0aI chose to talk about this grammatical construction because I have seen something similar in Latin, which I learned for several years. In Latin, the removal of forms of “to be” is a perfectly valid construction and is even often used for poetic purposes. The fact that people are discriminated against for using a grammatical construction that is often seen in languages across the world, but not in Standardized American English, seems very unfair to me because there is no “best” or “most correct” variety of a language.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221113-235615-290850#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Null Copula in Headlinese %0a-> - johnternullo%0a-> [-13.11.2022 - 15:56-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221113-235615-290850 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aHeadlinese is a term used for the English used in headlines such as those found in newspapers.%0a%0aHeadlinese differs from most varieties of English due to being influenced by the need to condense information into shorter titles and to grab the attention of readers.%0a%0aAs a result, headlines often appear without forms of the verb "to be" where they would be present in other dialects of English.%0a%0aThe indefinite and definite articles are also frequently removed, and the infinitive form of a verb can be used to represent the future tense.%0a%0aExample:%0a"Tribe officials acquitted in North Dakota pipeline protests"%0aAs opposed to "Tribe officials are acquitted..." in other varieties of English%0a%0a%0ahttps://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/null-copula%0ahttp://www.isabelperez.com/module4_tesis/headlines.htm%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221113-235615-290850#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: E:)%0a(:Category: MorphosyntacticDiversityOfEnglish:)%0a(:Title: Null Copula:)
