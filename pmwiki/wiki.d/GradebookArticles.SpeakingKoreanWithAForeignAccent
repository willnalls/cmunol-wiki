As Korea is a homogenous nation with mainly Koreans, there is a lack of diversity when compared to a country such as America. Therefore, they are not as used to foreign accents and view them in a negative manner. Some characteristics of a foreign Korean accent include not being able to pronounce tense and aspirated consonants.%0a%0aThe article specifically follows K-Pop artists or entertainers in the industry that are not native Koreans. Many of these people are subject to criticism when speaking Korean, not their first language, with an accent. Mispronunciation and accents are made fun of by Korean variety show hosts, reporters, and the general public.
