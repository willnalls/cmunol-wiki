One ''take'' on life is to be confident and ''take'' what you want in life. So be sure to ''take'' that adventure you always wanted to go on, and ''take'' on your fears, because life is short. ''Take'' love, for example. You can be completely ''taken'' with someone and ''take'' them to dinner. When you arrive at the restaurant, you help them ''take'' off their coat and ''take'' their hand as you walk to the table. Well, hopefully that illustrated my point on polysemy – I think it’s time for me to ''take'' off now. Bye!%0a%0aThe polysemy and frequent use of the word “take” in the language of the Nacirema reinforces the idea that their society is highly materialistic and focused on individual gain. The word “take” has many meanings, but one of the most frequent uses is when it means to acquire or to gain. People are encouraged to “take” what they want in life, and a model of Nacirema culture is someone who is highly driven to attain the things they want, rising from the lowest societal status and becoming extremely (materially) wealthy. The prevalence of this word suggests also that the welfare of the individual is placed above the welfare of the community in the society of the Nacirema – “taking” rather than “giving” or “contributing” to the collective welfare of the group. %0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: LanguageOfTheNacirema:)%0a(:if authgroup @tas:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]]%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!LanguageOfTheNacirema]]%0a%0a!Philosophy Lessons from Take%0a%0a:Author: ShahinC%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aThe word Take and its many different meanings%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aWe can TAKE something from somebody else, although it probably would not be the right thing to do, in most cases.
