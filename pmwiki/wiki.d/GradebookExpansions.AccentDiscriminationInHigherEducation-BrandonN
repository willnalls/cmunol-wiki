Although linguistic discrimination may be present, I wonder how warranted the judgment is. It seems that the Asian professors have worse evaluations, but the clarity aspect may be justified if students are unable to understand them. An area that could be looked into is the clarity evaluation of non-Asian professors who have an accent (e.g. a professor with a thick German accent). Linguistic discrimination is something that we should work to bring awareness to, but I also think students can have trouble understanding professors with thicker accents. Being Asian myself, I don't have too much trouble understanding an Asian professor, but I really would like to see information on other accents and their evaluations.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
