A user by the name of “rastabonez” posted on Urban Dictionary the definition, which reads as "A process by which a group or individual obtains a subjective assessment of the mental and emotional state of another person, place or thing" (1). Often used as a noun, "vibe check" has found itself commonplace in recent pop culture and everyday use. However, it has still not found its way into the Oxford English Dictionary. In accordance with lexicographer Kory Stamper’s methodology, there are three things to consider when speculating about this word’s addition to the dictionary: widespread use, sustained use, and meaning. As such, the objective of this article is to present arguments for the word’s addition to the dictionary.%0a%0aThough introduced in 2011, the word has gained popularity in recent years. Twitter user “umru_” reintroduced the word when he first tweeted “vibe check?” on March 24, 2019. Soon after on April 2, 2019, Twitter user “cake_hoarder” also tweeted “vibe check” on the site which marked the progression of the word’s resurgence (2). Later that year, Google Trends data recorded that a peak in usage occurred around November 2019 (3). This was around the time that a series of internet comics depicting the word paired with fictionalized comedic violence went viral. As a result, the word was soon fully revitalized and brought back into the mainstream (4). This led to an explosion of online articles exclusively covering this word, along with the word spreading throughout multiple social media platforms and becoming regularly used as slang. %0a%0aSince 2019, “vibe check” has maintained its usage to this day. Multiple media outlets continue to reference it, such as BuzzFeed writing multiple articles and pages on it yearly since 2019 (5). Furthermore, several musical artists in recent years have discography incorporating the word into their lyrics. One such example is Olivia Lunny and Bhad Bhabie’s song “VIBE CHECK”. The lyric reads “You’re the one who passed my vibe check”, which provides a proper example of the word’s meaning in use (6). A brief glance at the #vibecheck hashtag on Twitter provides a plethora of daily posts using the words. In the last five days, Twitter Analytics data reports the word being used in over 100 tweets and even more so when looking further into past data (7). Despite Google Trends data reporting a drop in usage since November 2019 (3), the word has proved its continued use through multiple channels and outlets, along with it cementing itself in verbal usage as well.%0a%0aIn regards to meaning, “vibe check” is derived from the preexisting words “vibe” and “check”. “Vibe” in this context refers to a slang word meaning “A distinctive emotional atmosphere; sensed intuitively” (8). %0a%0aIn final consideration of Stamper’s methodology, a clear argument has been made for the addition of “vibe check” to the Oxford English Dictionary. If added to the dictionary, “vibe check” would make way for a whole new era of psychological processes and psychoanalysis. %0a%0aSources:%0a%0a%0a(1) https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vibe%2520Check&page=3%0a%0a(2) https://twitter.com/umru_/status/1109714792049188864?ref_src=twsrc%255Etfw%257Ctwcamp%255Etweetembed%257Ctwterm%255E1109714792049188864%257Ctwgr%255Eca592f44698bb8e00c52170ca393a65bbc53698c%257Ctwcon%255Es1_&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fhappymag.tv%252Fvibe-check-meme-explained%252F%0a%0a(3) https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2004-01-01%25202022-09-02&q=vibe%2520check%0a%0a(4) https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vibe-check%0a%0a(5) https://www.buzzfeed.com/search?q=vibe+check%0a%0a(6) https://genius.com/Olivia-lunny-and-bhad-bhabie-vibe-check-lyrics%0a%0a(7) https://www.trackmyhashtag.com/preview/overview?_token=Rc08EYxXER16VsmUzxxZuUpdTwskE7UGxQHnLUym&req_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.trackmyhashtag.com%252Fhashtag-analytics&report_type=realtime&search_keyword=%2523vibecheck%0a%0a(8) https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vibe%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: FunWithWords:)%0a(:Title: Vibe Check:)
