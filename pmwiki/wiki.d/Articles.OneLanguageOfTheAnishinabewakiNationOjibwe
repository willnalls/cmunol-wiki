The Anishinabewaki Nation was the first to inhabit that area of Michigan and part of Canada. Another spelling I saw was Anishinaabe but I’m not sure which is favored. The Anishinabewaki Nation was first comprised of the Ojibway tribe (providers), Odawa tribe (warriors), and Potawatomi tribe (firekeepers), aka the “three fires”. More tribes have joined as time went on. Here is my phonetic transcription of Anishinabewaki: ɑniʃɛnɑbɛwɑki. The Union of Ontario Indians was established in 1949 to represent most of the First Nations in Ontario. This group was used for political reasons and still is today. Today, it represents 39 Anishinabek nations and works to create a sense of unity between the indigenous people as well as provide services for their people. %0a%0aAlthough the three fires originally joined partly because of language similarity, the people of the Anishinabewaki Nation speak different languages including Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Algonquin. I’m just going to focus on Ojibwe though. The language isn’t widely spoken, those who do are mostly elders. It seems like there are revitalization efforts to save the language from dying out. Some projects include immersion classrooms, the publification of books written by elders, and more. Also, one of the sources mentioned the development of a Rosetta Stone app that could be used via smartphone to learn the language. The language is being taught only in a select number of schools within the community and people can sign up for classes via Zoom. I couldn’t find an exact number for people who speak Ojibwe so I didn’t want to put false information on this article, but I do know that Ojibwe is an “endangered” language.%0a%0aI searched up “Anishinabewaki language” into Google and went to the Wikipedia page for the last part. It said that the languages spoken are English, French, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Algonquin, which honestly sounds pretty legit. The Anishinabewaki was located in the northern United States and areas of Canada surrounding. So this land had British and French colonists, which would make sense if the indigenous people picked up their language over time. Another thing I noticed was that it mainly referred to them with the other spelling Anishaabe, so maybe that way is more common than Anishinabewaki. Finally, it talked about how there were 6 clans that made up the Anishinabewaki but I don’t remember reading anything about that in the two Indigenous websites I looked at. %0a%0a%0aSources: %0ahttps://millelacsband.com/news/ge-niigaanizijig-language-program%0ahttps://www.anishinabek.ca/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/%0ahttps://native-land.ca/maps/territories/anishinabek-%25e1%2590%258a%25e1%2593%2582%25e1%2594%2591%25e1%2593%2588%25e1%2590%25af%25e1%2592%2583/%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe#:~:text=The%2520Anishinaabe%2520speak%2520Anishinaabemowin%252C%2520or,%2522people%2520from%2520whence%2520lowered%2522.%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221658-614280#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221658-614280#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
