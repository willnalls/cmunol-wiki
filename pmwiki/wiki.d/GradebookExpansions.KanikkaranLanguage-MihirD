For example, even in central-west India where Hindi and Marathi are the most spoken languages, there are communities of people  who speak isolated and endangered languages. For example, near the border of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh there are people of the Korku tribe, who speak an Austroasiatic language (700,000 speakers) related more closely to more east Indian tribal languages. The Nihali people also live alongside the Korku, traditionally working as farm laborers for people outside their community. The Nihali language is endangered with only 2,500 speakers. It borrows most of its vocabulary from the neighboring languages, but otherwise it's an isolate language (no language family). Some people say it's only used today to prevent people from outside the community from understanding them. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
