According to OED, “run” is a merging of two originally distinct Old English words, probably reinforced in Middle English by borrowing of cognate forms from early Scandinavian. The first word originally meant “to run, to flow, to go by, pass, to make for, (of land) to extend, to border (on), adjoin, etc.” while the second meant “to glue together, to hunt, drive on, to collect together, etc.” Definitions such as “run loose,” “run over to get some sugar,” “run up and down the scales” likely stem from the first definition, while definitions of the word in “run a fever, run up one’s spine, run a red light, and run for president” are probably derived from the second definition.  %0a%0aRewriting the second paragraph with a different interpretation: As opposed to what the paragraph says: “the Nacirema culture focuses on progress and moving forward without staying caught up on one thing for too long,” the polysemy of “run” actually reveals the instability of Nacirema society and their everyday life. Because everything is so transient and unstable, the Nacirema people have no choice but to have a life of turmoil and unrest. They are used to hastiness, “running for a position,” “running to the doctor,” and even “run” as daily exercise, lest they lost everything they have in a split second.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
