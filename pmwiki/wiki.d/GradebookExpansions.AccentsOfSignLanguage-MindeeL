I found out that in addition to ASL (which is used by the Deaf community and has its own grammar and syntax), there is a common type of signing called PSE which is usually used to communicate between hearing and deaf people. PSE stands for pigdin signed english and it follows English grammar but uses words/vocabulary from ASL. I wonder if the accent of hearing people when they sign is influenced from their knowledge of spoken english and looks more similar to PSE than "accent-less/standard" ASL. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
