When learning French or Spanish, for example, words are different, but the spoken languages generally share a common system of writing. In my experience, the ability to write the other language is a large part of learning/memorization. However, when trying to learn a language that doesn't share a writing system with English such as Arabic or Hebrew, there doesn't seem to be as easy a way to start learning the language without someone or something that is fluent in both languages to help bridge the gap in between them.
