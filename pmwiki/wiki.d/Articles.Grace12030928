While GPT-3 is classified as a NLP tool, it demonstrates both the immense progress that NLP has made in the last few years, and the wide variety of tasks that NLP is applicable to. %0a%0aWith regards to the former, Grace mentioned that NLP can be used detect spam, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and more. GPT-3 is merely one model, but can do all of these things. For example, a user can query GPT-3 do do essentially whatever they want (with no guarantees that GPT-3 will succeed). But if GPT-3 senses that the query is unethical in some way, or could be used in a negative manner (say writing mean things about someone), it will refuse to answer. Likewise, GPT-3 will "happily" provide summaries of just about any media, whether it is a text, or a video, or music. This demonstrates a deep "understanding" per se of human speech. The model can determine what a human speaker means, not just what the words themselves mean, relatively accurately.%0a%0aWith regard to the latter, GPT-3 displays some of the more adjacent usages of NLP nicely. For example, a standard usage of NLP could be telling a model to write a computer program that does specific things (ex. Write a program that traverses through an array and returns the largest value within), but while GPT-3 is able to do this, it is also able to answer these questions somewhat indirectly. That is, instead of being told explicitly how to write something, it can be told the desired outcome (write a program to find the maximum difference between ancestor and child in a binary tree) and do so while "figuring out" how to do it on its own.%0a%0aAdmittedly, GPT-3 is limited by its training set. If a programming question was not included in some way while it was being trained, it will not be able to solve it, or if another specific task was never trained for the same will be true. Additionally,  its outputs are not consistently correct, despite the models "confidence" that they are, so someone must comb through the results to check them over. Even so, it is a wonder how much NLP technologies have improved recently, displayed most easily by GPT-3. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221209-185716-102290#%0a#foxbegin 221210-022021-956910#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!A brief history of NLP development %0a-> - ziqiliu%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 18:20-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221210-022021-956910 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aNatural Language Processing research started off in 1950 with Turing's paper called "intelligence" which proposes what is known as the Turing Test today. %0a%0aThe first task that NLP researchers tried to solve is Machine Translation during the World War II (1960-ish).
