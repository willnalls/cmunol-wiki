Outside of this, the term has also seen wide usage in heterosexual female communities as a way to describe a desirable male partner who will reject the popular expectations regarding masculinity and assist with traditionally "feminine" chores in the domestic sphere (raising children, cooking, etc.) (1).  %0a%0a*see article by mahikav for more information on this term: https://cmunol-wiki.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Articles.Mahikav09011224%0a%0a(1) tiredGirlie. “Malewife.” Urban Dictionary, April 18, 2022. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=malewife. %0a%0a(2) Loreil et al. “Girlboss and Malewife.” Know Your Meme, 2021. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/girlboss-and-malewife. %0a%0a(3) "The Female Husband and Male Wife."
