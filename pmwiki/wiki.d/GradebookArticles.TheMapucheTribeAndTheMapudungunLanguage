The Mapuche were the original stewards of a wide territory in the southern cone from the west coast in Chile to the east coast in Argentina. The collective name of the tribe is Mapuche, but Mapuches call themselves by different names depending on where they live. "For example the Huilliche, people from the south, the Lafkenche, people from the west or the Nagche, people of the valley." There is no preferred name.

However, if the government or company provides a piece of land of equal value then a transfer can take place. But only if both groups agree to the deal.%0a%0aThere are about 1.3 million Mapuches living in South America although there used to be many more. Also, there are no significant reclamation efforts underway or pedagogical resources for learning the language, Mapudungun. This is because in Chile's rigid class structure, Mapuches are seen as the lowest class. Because of this, it is not uncommon for Mapuches to change their names to sound Chilean, or for parents to not teach their children Mapudungun.%0a%0aBecause of this, in urban areas Mapudungun is spoken mostly ceremoniously during cultural celebrations involving dancing and music.
