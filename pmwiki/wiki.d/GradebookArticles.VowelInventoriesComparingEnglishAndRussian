For example, a native speaker of a language with a small or average vowel inventory may have difficulty dissecting speech from a language with a large vowel inventory. This effect is also due to the fact that languages do not necessarily share common vowels, leading to a steeper learning curve in pronunciation of new vowels.%0a%0aEnglish has a vowel inventory size of 15, while Russian has a vowel inventory size of 5. The 5 vowels present in Russian (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) are also present in English, presumably allowing native Russian speakers to have little difficulty in understanding these sounds. On the other hand, commonly used vowels in English such as /æ/, /ʌ/, /ɪ/ are not present in Russian. To put this into perspective, words such as “pan”, “pun”, and “pin” contain vowel sounds foreign to Russian speakers.%0a%0aThe limited vowel inventory size in Russian raises some intriguing questions about the effects vowel inventory size has on other features of a language. From a simplified combinatorial perspective, a word in English with 3 vowel sounds has up to 3,375 (15^3) assignments for those vowels while Russian has 125 (5^3) assignments. This raises the question of whether vowel inventory corresponds with the compactness of a language, i.e. does vowel inventory have some significant correlation with word length, sentence length, etc.?%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
