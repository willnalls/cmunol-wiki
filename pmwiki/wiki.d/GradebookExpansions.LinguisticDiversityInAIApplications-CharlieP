This is largely due to a lack of financial incentive and trouble finding speakers to build a dataset. However, with the rapid rise of AI speech recognition, increasing diversity and robustness of existing AI systems is becoming more important, as well. Some companies have started to take note, with Cambridge's Speechmatics specializing entirely in generating a corpus of English from speakers all over the world. The corpus, named "Global English", uses thousands of hours of speech data from over 40 countries with tens of billions of words. I really think this is a large step forward in the development of speech recognition, and I could definitely see it become an industry standard to use such a data set and test with different speakers from all over the globe. Speechmatics recently launched on Microsoft Azure Marketplace, meaning that any type of developer can use their dataset and technology to develop a speech recognition system, which is a huge step forward in reducing the accent gap. %0a%0aSource: %0ahttps://www.speechmatics.com%0ahttps://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=145957%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:Category:)%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
