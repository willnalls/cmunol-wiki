The crocs appear to speak a dialect other than Standard English, pronouncing [ð] as [d], [ɪ] as [i] (orthographically writing "is" as "ees", for example), and consonant deletion (orthographically writing "zebra" as "zeeba") as seen in this example: https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2016/04/20. The crocs' consonant deletion seems to not follow any specific rule like first consonant deletion or final consonant deletion, as the crocs also delete the [l] in "please" in this example https://thecomicninja.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/pearls-before-swine-4/ and delete the [t] in "just" in this example: https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2012/08/31. The crocs also appear to pronounce [θ] as [f] as seen in the previous link. %0a%0aThe crocs' dialect appears to be a blend of AAVE and dialects commonly found among non-native English speakrs. For example, the crocs' pronunciation of dental fricatives as either a [d] or a [f] depending on the location of the fricative and the crocs' deletion of the [t] in a word-final [st] is typically found in AAVE. On the other hand, the crocs' pronunciation of [ɪ] as [i]as [i] seems to be a characteristic of non-native English speakers. %0a%0aThe comic seems to be criticizing these dialects' pronunciation of dental fricatives for alveolar plosives and labiodental fricatives, consonant deletion, and pronunciation of the lax high front vowel [ɪ] as the tense high front vowel [i]. This is because the gag of the comics with crocs usually revolves around the crocs' lack of common sense, such as when they run into a glass window or when they forget to chew their food. By making the crocs seem unintelligent and airheaded, the comic's author is basically reinforcing the stereotyped that people who speak AAVE and non-native English speakers are dumb and inferior to those who speak Standard English. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
