For example, a new PASL sign is a tap on the arm, meaning a "nod." This "nod" is meant as a form of backchanneling, where small acknowledgments are passed back from the listener to the speaker to indicate that the listener is understanding. In typical ASL this is communicated through conventional means, such as nodding or looking at the speaker, but deafblind people cannot use these methods to communicate. An additional feature of PASL is the capability for multiple people to have a conversation at once. Typical PASL signs are designed such that multiple listeners can touch the speaker's hands at once to join in on the conversation.
