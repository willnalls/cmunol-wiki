In certain parts of the UK it is common for people to speak with what is known as "th-fronting". This is when people pronounce /θ/ as /f/. Evans speaks in this way, and has received numerous complaints and rude comments from listeners including "Firty, free and fousand aren't numbers I've ever heard of" - when he was announcing lottery numbers - and "I'm for free speech, but please can people speak properly?". According to BBC, they are trying to make an effort to have the way their announcers speak be representative of the entire UK, however it seems that some outspoken members of their audience have very strong opinions on what is the "correct" way to speak. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
