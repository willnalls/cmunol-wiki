The midwest has a long history with indigenous appropriation. Skokie’s village insignia is still problematically a Native American chief. One of the tribes who were the traditional stewards of the land was the Myaamia ([maɪʝmiə]) tribe. They are often referred to as the Miami tribe but the true name in their language is Myaamia, meaning “the downstream people”. I don’t think this tribe is officially listed in the cession, but cession 148 is a treaty that extended over land that is considered part of the tribe’s homeland before forced removal from various regions concentrated the tribe in Miami, Oklahoma. The spoken language is the Miami-Illinois language. The tribe is working hard and several programs and  initiatives related to language learning. There is also a Myaamia Center at Miami University which has a language research office dedicated to studying and collecting knowledge on the language. The office is undertaking many projects, including an online learner’s dictionary and teaching grammar of the language and contributing academic publications about the language in the linguistics field. I was unable to find information on who and how many folks speak the language, but it seems like it is in use currently, and is used day to day. For example, many words are incorporated in the history section of the Myaamia tribe’s official website. %0a%0aIn reading the Wikipedia page for this language it is clear my summary definitely would have been different than the one I have already written. It seems factual enough, but the real differences are in emphasis. The focus and purpose of the Myaamia produced materials are about their history and the way their people were forcibly removed and killed in large numbers and that currently they are doing their best to revive their language and preserve their community and culture. Wikipedia glosses over these facts and is clinically focused on the details of the language. Furthermore, it dedicates a large section to a European missionary who documented some of the language into French. %0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Illinois_language %0ahttp://www.native-languages.org/miami-illinois.htm %0ahttps://www.miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/index.html %0ahttps://miamination.com/node/11 %0ahttps://digitreaties.org/treaties/cession/148/ %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
