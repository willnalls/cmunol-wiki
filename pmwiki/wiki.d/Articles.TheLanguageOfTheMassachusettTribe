Members of the tribe referred to themselves as ‘Massachusee’ (IPA: /məhsatʃəwiːsiː/) in the singular and ‘Massachuseuk’ (IPA: /məhsatʃəwiːsiːak/) in the plural. They are descendants of the Neponset band of the Massachusett.%0a%0aThe tribe speaks the Massachusett language, which is also known as Wôpanâak. It belongs to the Algonquian language family and was the first American Indian language to develop and use an alphabetic writing system. The Massachusett people, as well as most other peoples of New England who spoke a pidgin variety of the language as a regional lingua franca, referred to the language as Massachusett/Massachusee unnontoowaonk (IPA: /mɑːsatʃuːsət/mmɑːsatʃuːsiː ənãtuːaːãk/).%0a%0aMuch of the use of Massachusett was obstructed and destroyed by British colonizers. However, a prominent project that has attempted to revitalize Massachusett is the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project, which began in 1993 under Jessie ‘Little Doe’ Baird. It was introduced through the joint collaborative efforts of members of The Assonet Band of Wampanoag, The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, the Wampanoag Tribe of Aquinnah and the Herring Pond Band of Wampanoag. The language also seems to have been partially maintained through religious documents (in the 17th century, an evangelist translated the English Bible to Massachusett).
