The accuracy jumps to 99.89 percent when a morphological analyzer preprocesses the word and gives the algorithm information about the morphemes.

The algorithm tries to optimize these quantities, and has a runtime that is linear in the length of the word. The researchers also tested the algorithm on Bengali, in which case the accuracy was about 85 percent on 1000 randomly selected words.
