During the colonial period and the subsequent establishment of current nation states such as Canada and the United States, European settlers and governments seized Indigenous land, killed and displaced Indigenous people, and prohibited the use of Indigenous languages.  Some of these actions date back to the early years of first contact, but many of the official policies that harm Indigenous people, cultures, and languages have continued until recently, and some continue today.  For example, the governments of both the United States and Canada used residential schools as a tool for the eradication of the languages and cultures of Indigenous people.  To give you a sense of just how recent this history is, the last residential school in the US closed in the 1970s; in Canada, the last residential school closed in 1996.%0a%0aAs a result of this history, the use of Indigenous languages declined dramatically.  An internet search for Indigenous languages of the Americas will turn up a variety of sources that discuss language endangerment and extinction.  Indeed, many Indigenous languages are severely threatened, with only a handful of people living who use the language, while others have no users at all, and are said to be extinct.  For many languages, however, this is only half the story, as many sources fail to mention that there are reclamation efforts underway.%0a%0aWhy is this important?  There are several reasons.  One of the biggest problems is that typical representations of Indigenous people is that they were and not that they are.  Talking about entire peoples and cultures as though they existed only in the past is a way of erasing them in the present, thereby presenting them as some kind of historic relic that non-Indigenous people, and in particular, those who hold positions of institutional power, don’t have to grapple with today.  But this is false.  Indigenous people exist, their cultures exist, and their languages, though endangered, exist.%0a%0aAnother problem is that many of the sources are not written by Indigenous people themselves.  Within linguistics and other related fields, Indigenous languages have often been treated as an object of study by non-Indigenous people, and work by Indigenous scholars has often not been regarded as scholarship.%0a%0aAt this point, I think it’s important to contextualise this document.  It was written by me, Dr. Christina Bjorndahl.  I claim no Indigenous ancestry, and in fact I have only recently begun to learn about the problems with the representation of Indigenous people in linguistics.  Indeed, it was only a couple of semesters ago that I presented information about Indigenous languages by discussing endangerment and extinction, citing non-Indigenous sources, and making only passing reference to revitalisation and reclamation efforts.%0a%0aSo in many ways I’m still new at this.  Over the last year, I’ve had the enormous fortune of working with Dr. Wesley Leonard, a linguist of Miami (Myaamia) ancestry.  Indeed, everything I’ve written to this point is based on my interpretation of conversations we’ve had, and papers that he and other Indigenous linguists have written.  Of course, any failings in the preceding summary are strictly my own.  We will be reading some of Dr. Leonard’s work this semester.%0a%0aThis year I’m using the wiki to try a new way of incorporating Indigenous languages into 80-180 in a way that I hope will be more respectful.  There are two parts to this.  In part 1 (one of the essential categories), you are asked to find information about an Indigenous language, using Indigenous sources as much as possible; details are below.  In part 2, you are asked to discuss some aspect of the same language using the terms and concepts that we have discussed in class, and asked to reflect on how Indigenous languages are presented and objectified. %0a%0a!!Part 1 (essential)%0aTo do this exercise, you are asked to select a place in North or South America that you have some connection to, broadly construed.  For example, the location you choose could be the place you’re from, or a place you visited as a child, but it could also be a place you remember from a movie, or somewhere you’ve always wanted to visit.  You will have to select a place that no one else in the class has selected, so you should think of several options!%0a%0aGo to [[https://native-land.ca/]] (links to an external site).  Enter the place name in the search bar, as follows:%0a%0a%25width:600px%25 Attach:p1.jpg%0a%0aThe map will then zoom in to your selected location, and will tell you the name of the people who were the original stewards of the land.%0a%0a%25width:600px%25 Attach:p2.jpg%0a%0aThen go [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1EQX80Dor2Uku21_Ag2Vcf6eFskdZuo58&usp=sharing|here]] (links to an external site -- you may have to use a non-CMU login to access this map), where you can add the place to the map.   This allows us to build a map of the Indigenous languages that NoL students are investigating this term.  This is also where you can see if the place you chose has already been chosen; if so, please choose a different place.%0a%0aThe language you will be investigating is the language that was spoken by the original people of that land.  If there are multiple tribes listed, then choose one; it is okay if you choose a tribe that someone else has chosen, provided that you write your own summary.%0a%0aFollow the links provided in the results section of native-land.ca to learn more about the people and language.  Most of the links for more information will take you to websites that are run by the Indigenous tribe in question.  As a first pass, use only information that you can get from Indigenous-run sites.  If you cannot obtain information from an Indigenous site, then say that, but do not go elsewhere for information.%0a%0aFor the wiki, write a short summary that discusses the following:%0a* [+ Why did you choose that place? +]%0a* [+ Who were the traditional stewards of the land?  What is the name of the tribe?  Are there multiple names?  Are some names more preferred than others?  Write an IPA transcription of the name. +]%0a* [+ What treaties relate to the land in question? +]%0a* [+ What is the status of the language?  Are there revitalization or reclamation efforts underway?  Are there native speakers of the language?  Are there pedagogical resources to learn the language?  Is it in use by people today, and how is it used?  In daily life?  Ceremonially?  Administratively? +]%0a* [+ Is there any data about how many speakers there are? +]%0a* [+ After you’ve written your summary, do a search for the language on the internet at large, and select a site that is not Indigenous-run, such as Wikipedia.  If you were to write a summary of the language based only on non-Indigenous sources, how would it be different?  Would the facts change?  The presentation change?  What differences can you spot in the way that the language is described or in the way that examples are presented?  Be sure to include links to the sites that you use in your summary and discussion. +]%0a%0a!!Expansions%0aThere are two ways to expand upon this article.  The first way is to describe some aspect of the phonology, morphology, or syntax of the language, using the terminology, transcription, and concepts that you have learned in class.  This is the only category for which you are allowed to submit an expansion for your own article, and you can only add an expansion to your own article if you do so in this manner.  Your summary cannot be a description of the sound inventory, unless it also includes a description of a phonological process.  You must describe the phenomenon in prose and include some examples.%0a%0aAnother option is to expand upon someone else's article, in the following ways:%0a%0a%0a* [+ Add additional historical information +]%0a* [+ Discuss the language reclamation efforts in more depth +]%0a* [+ Find instances of literature or artwork of the tribe, etc. +]%0a* [+ Write a reflection of the representation of a particular Indigenous language; were you taught about the language or the tribe in school?  How does the information presented here differ from what you were taught? +]%0a* [+ If an article has already been expanded upon with a description of a phenomenon, you can also find additional language examples, particularly of texts that exemplify the phenomenon, or if the example is well-known in the linguistics literature, summarise the instances that it has been cited, and discuss whether these works also cite Indigenous scholars, or whether the example has been used only as an object of inquiry. +]%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----
