Most people in Singapore do not have any problems with the use of Singlish in private settings such as at home or with friends. However, the use of Singlish in official or educational settings such as schools or as frontline staff working in government departments remains controversial. While some people view the use of Singlish as a unique and important part of Singaporean identity and culture, others view the use of Singlish as unprofessional and thus not appropriate for use in official settings.%0a%0aWhile Singlish is largely derived from British English, it is different from British English in a wide variety of areas ranging from phonology to syntax. These differences are largely attributed to prolonged language contact with other common languages in Singapore such as Mandarin, Hokkien, Malay, and Tamil. The social media post linked below contains many criticisms of Singlish. However, I will focus on the first two criticisms. %0a%0aThe author criticizes the syntax, more specifically the word order, of Singlish. For example, the sentence “Why you so like that one” is grammatical for some speakers of Singlish, but not grammatical in Standard American English or British English. The author points to the fact that this appears to be a direct translation of the Mandarin sentence “你为什么这样的”, to argue the point that Singlish is derived from bad English and an inability to master English tenses and grammar. %0a%0aThe author also criticizes the use of particles such as “ah” or “lah” or “lor”, which are often used at the end of phrases or sentences to provide additional context and meaning to the phrase or sentence. These particles appear to be derived from other languages such as Hokkien or Mandarin. However, the author suggests that the use of these particles is a “beginner’s use of various sounds and gestures to replace complex vocabulary” and is indicative of the user’s lack of vocabulary. %0a%0aOverall, the author seems to suggest that the use of Singlish is a failing on the part of the user, as it signifies the user’s lack of mastery of English.%0a%0aReferences:%0ahttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/1-5-ethnic-minorities-surveyed-reported-greater-language-prejudice-now-5-years-ago-study%0ahttps://www.facebook.com/brainarchitect/posts/172824647613088%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_mason:)
