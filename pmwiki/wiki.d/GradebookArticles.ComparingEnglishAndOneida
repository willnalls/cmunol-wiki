When comparing the English language to other languages, the common consonant sounds that are typically missing are bilabials, fricatives, and nasals. English itself has all common consonant sounds present. The main comparison with Oneida is the absence of a bilabial sound, or the sound made when the lips come together and touch. As a result of the absent bilabial sound, Oneida is missing common consonant sounds to the English language that stems from plosives such as "p" and "b". Additionally, the Oneida language is also mostly missing the nasal consonant. As a result of the absent consonant sounds, Oneida only has consonants in the alveolar, velar, and glottal places.%0a%0aEnglish vastly differs from the Oneida language. As previously compared, the Oneida language lacks different sounds while English has a more exhaustive use of sounds ranging from bilabial to glottal. English specifically contains the common bilabial sounds of "p" and "b" which shows the clear difference from the Native American language. %0a%0aI am not familiar with the Oneida language in any capacity, but I was curious to see how a language would operate without the use of a common consonant sound. My first thought was that Oneida might use other consonant sounds more heavily missing one such as the bilabial, but in fact, it turned out to be the opposite. What made this language interesting is the small use of consonant sounds that focused on the alveolar, velar, and glottal. I am still curious as to how Oneida communicates or if it can communicate as well as other languages since it is missing consonant sounds compared to the English language. My overarching question to the Oneida language in addition to others is: Does missing common consonant sounds affect the quality of communication for the language?%0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://wals.info/chapter/18%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/18A#2/44.1/152.8%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/77#tipa%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
