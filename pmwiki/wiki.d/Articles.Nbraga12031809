While others may argue that it is all about determination, and motivation. However, according to Emily Sohn, who wrote an article on the brain chemistry of polyglots, explain that both play a huge part in learning a new language. Although learning a new language when the brain has not fully developed is scientifically proven to be easier, it is possible to learn a language later on. Furthermore, when you learn a language in your childhood you are more likely to remember sounds that are more native sounding. According to neurolinguistic, Loraine Obler, “By the age of 9 to 12 months, for example, babies begin to lose the ability to distinguish between sounds that are not used in their native language.” To conclude, although learning a language at a young age is significantly easier, it is possible to learn a new language later on in life. %0a%0ahttps://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna46784028%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 221209-203505-744290#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Expansion on learning language  %0a-> - adrian%0a-> [-09.12.2022 - 12:35-]%0a>>rfloat%3c%3c   %0a(:if1 authgroup @tas:)%0a{[foxdelrange button 221209-203505-744290 {$FullName} ]}%0a(:if1end:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThe Critical Period Hypothesis proposed by Eric Lenneberg suggests that there is a certain time period for when you can learn new languages fairly easily.

So people who learn languages at an earlier age are more likely to learn better than someone who learns it much later. There was a feral child that was named Victor of Aveyron that was found at 9 years old. It seemed that he was living in the wild by himself prior to that, and so he never learned a language and didn't communicate at all. Jean Marc Gaspard Itard attempted to teach him a language, and Victor was able to eventually understand some basic actions, but he was never able to understand our language. So from his specific case, it's possible that he wasn't as good at learning language, but there are also many other factors so this question still remains to be answered.%0a%0ahttps://news.mit.edu/2018/cognitive-scientists-define-critical-period-learning-language-0501%0a%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_of_Aveyron#Language%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 221209-203505-744290#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: F:)%0a(:Category: EndangeredLanguages:)%0a(:Title: Are some people just better at learning languages than others?:)%0a(:if [ authgroup @tas || authgroup @admins || equal {$Author} '' ]:)%0a%0a(:toggle id=gi show="show grading interface" hide="hide grading interface":)%0a%0a>>id=gi%3c%3c%0a%0a[[GradebookArticles.{$Name}|See article in gradebook]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=diff|See all changes to article]] \\%0a[[{$FullName}?action=edit|Edit this page]] \\%0aStatus: {GradebookArticles.{$Name}$:Status} %0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradeitem:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#gradingcomment:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a[[!{$:Category}]]%0a%0a!Are some people just better at learning languages than others?%0a%0a:Author: nbraga%0a%0a'''Summary:''' \\%0a%0a[[#summary]]%0a%0aAre some people just better at learning languages than others?%0a%0a[[#summaryends]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#content]]%0a%0aWell, some may argue that the ability of learning languages is solely based on the makeup of someone’s genes.
