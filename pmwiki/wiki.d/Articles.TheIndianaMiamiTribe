Revitalization is usually thought of as trying to achieve mass fluency, but Leonard is more concerned with reclaiming the language for cultural purposes. He writes, “When  we  talk  about  language  and  cultural  revitalization,  we  are  in  essence  referring  to  the  revitalization  of  belief,  value  and  knowledge  systems.  It  is  through  our  language  and  culture  that  we  express  those  ways  of  knowing.” The main focus is “breathing new life into it”, and applying it to the Miami tribe’s roles in the modern world. At cultural reclamation camps for children like eewansaapita camp, they learn basic vocabulary, a number song in myaamia, and ball games where the points are recorded in myaamia. Songs, games, and other regular communication are some of the methods being used to reclaim the Miami language and apply it to modern contexts.%0a%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210424-190019-782190#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a#foxbegin 210412-221659-758980#%0a(:if1 equal {$:Author} {$Author}:)%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a(:if1end:)%0a#foxend 210412-221659-758980#%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)
