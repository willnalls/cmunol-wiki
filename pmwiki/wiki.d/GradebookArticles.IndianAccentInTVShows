In this article, I will specifically talk about the "Indian American English." From the article, we see that major examples of such characters with "Indian American English" are: The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory. I would like to note that the article suggests that there is no such thing as "Indian American English" and that it is only an accent. %0a%0aThere are two common traits of the Indian American English accent. The first being: The [d] and [t] are two sounds that are primarily pronounced too far back in the mouth. Since the [d] and [t] sound do not exist in Indian languages, speakers often have to figure out how to properly pronounce the sound, and it is usually personified as a retroflex plosive. This is a criticism of the application of consonant substitution. Another example would be: the softening of the [r] sound. Comedians who carry out these roles often replace the r with variations: an alveolar tap [ɾ], a retroflex flap [ɽ], or an alveolar trill [r] based on the influence by the native phonology. This is also a criticism of the application of consonant substitution. %0a%0aAs stated earlier, I am not sure if this is really a dialect of English, but it is surely an accent. The criticized variants of the Indian American English accent is often stemming from the substitution of native American English consonants to other variations that is heavily influenced by the native phonologies of Indian languages. According to Wikipedia, the Indian government officially recognized 23 different languages spoken in India. Due to the wider population of Hindi speakers, the Indian American English personified in major American television series are often tailored towards a Hindi American English accent.%0a%0aFrom the source, I found that the usage of such characters and their attempt of mimicking the accent is often a comedic relief tool that pokes fun of Indian stereotypes. (Note: Triggering Statements) In The Simpsons, the character Apu is a corner shop owner who immigrated to the Unites States. In The Big Bang Theory, Rajesh Koothrappali is an astrophysicist who has selective mutism. In both examples, we can see that the shows personifies Indians as corner shop owners or exceptionally smart individuals with certain disabilities. Thus, the show masks English speakers with Indian language accents as these specific facades. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
