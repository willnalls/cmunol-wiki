Although it may seem like an 'n sound', pronouncing 'song' and, say, 'son' shows they occur at very different parts of the mouth, the velum vs the alveolar ridge, respectively. The three feature values listed for the trait are whether it appears as a word-initial consonant, it appears but not initially, or it appears not at all.%0a%0aThe largest difference between English and Basque (a language isolate spoken in the northern Iberian peninsula) in their use of the velar nasal is that Basque simply does not contain it at all. According to PHOIBLE, the velar nasal isn't even an allophone within Basque, so pronouncing it in the place of, say, [n], would in theory make the word gibberish. In addition, although English does use the velar nasal, as mentioned in class it is only permitted at the end of a word (for any fellow native English speakers, attempt to say something like [ŋo], I find it quite unnatural/difficult), distinguishing it from languages like Vietnamese where it may appear word-initially.%0a%0aThe largest question I have is concerning its apparent uniqueness. In his writing on the topic, Gregory D.S. Anderson notes that use of the velar nasal is uniquely grouped in bands across the globe, both by its permitted locations in words and its use outright. Although I understand that languages that developed near each other are likely to share sounds, that the even use of the consonant, or whether or not it can only appear in certain parts of words altogether is grouped so heavily, is very interesting to me. I wonder if any of this plays into human physiology, i.e. perhaps the velar nasal is uniquely a burden to pronounce, and thus finds itself so frequently with these grouped, distinct uses.%0a%0aSources:%0a%0aGregory D.S.
