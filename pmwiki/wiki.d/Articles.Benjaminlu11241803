It belongs to the Dravidian language group and is spoken by approximately three million Gondi people. Gondi is currently highly endangered, as it is only spoken by one-fifth of the Gondi people. The endangerment of Gondi can primarily be attributed to a language shift from Gondi to other regional languages that are used more commonly by the Gondi population. (1) Starting from the 19th century, the number of people that knew the Gondi language decreased drastically. It is said that by 1920, half the Gondi population had stopped speaking the language. Many Gondi people prioritize the more dominant languages, such as Marathi, Odia, Hindi, and Chhattisgarhi, because these languages are used more in education and business. (1) It is also mentioned that Gondi does not have any standard script, suggesting that it may be inconvenient. (2) Due to these reasons, many Gondi families stop learning Gondi and transition to the more dominant languages. As a result, many Gondi children lose the opportunity to learn the Gondi language, as their exposure to this language is highly reduced. Yet, many still show positive attitudes toward saving the Gondi language from extinction. (1) Many revival plans, such as the Gondi language revival project initiated by Nilanjan Bhowmik, aim to preserve Gondi and disseminate the cultural and historical significance behind this language.
