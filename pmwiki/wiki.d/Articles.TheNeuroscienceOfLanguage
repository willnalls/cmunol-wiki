One particular process, that affects all of us but especially this class, is the process of language, the brain regions involved, and further interesting findings. Language can be considered as one of these 'odd processes' because of the various skills and modalities used to comprehend both written or spoken language. %0a%0aPrevious to neuroimaging, the Wernicke's and Broca's areas were known to be involved in language, due to the observance of those who had those areas lesioned. They experienced two distinct cases of aphasia, a kind of deficit in speaking. Those with a lesion to Wernicke's area experienced Wernicke's aphasia, where their grammatical structure seemed intact as they spoke, but the comprehensibility of their words and the content of the sentence was not understandable. On the other side, those with a lesion to Broca's area experienced Broca's aphasia, where the grammatical structure of the sentence seemed completely interrupted and missing, but the content of the sentence was intact. Based on this, it was guessed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas solely have a hand in grammatical structure and comprehensibility, respectively. %0a%0a After neuroimaging studies started though, these areas became more and more understood. The primary finding is that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas do not have such simple rules as previously believe (this also extends generally to the rest of the brain.. each brain region is involved in so many tasks and skills)! For example, the Broca's area (called in most neuroscience literature as the Inferior Frontal Gyrus, or IFG), is made up of three distinct sections (called Brodmann's areas 44, 45, and 47) have different functions, like roles in phonological processing, semantic processing, and syntax. %0a%0aFor written language, other areas have been implicated, like the angular gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, and the 'visual word form area'. The first two mentioned here deal mostly with turning the orthogonal form (the written words and their form) into the phonological information about that word. The visual word form area (VWFA) is an interesting and special case in the literature, particularly since reading has not been around long enough for our brains to evolve to read. So, how do we use this area to read anyways?%0a%0aSome have argued that the VWFA is a case of 'neural recycling' where we reuse preexisting skills and constraints set by the brain and apply them to a new task. So, it is likely the VWFA has some general pattern recognition principle, that when applied to reading, helps us recognize distinct word forms.%0a%0aI could discuss further the strange neuroscience of language, but it is quite a dense topic.
