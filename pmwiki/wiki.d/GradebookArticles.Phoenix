In the native language family O'odham, "Akimel" means "river", and "O'odham" means "people". Therefore, the Akimel O'odham are those O'odham tribes which live on the rivers. There are two major groups within this one: the O'nk Akimel O'odham, who traditionally lived on the Salt River, and the Keli Akimel O'odham, who traditionally occupied the Gila River. In addition, there are also the Tohono O'odham, who are from the Sonoran desert, and the Ak-Chin Indian Community, who settled the washes. There are dialectal differences between the O'odham these peoples speak. The way I transcribed "O'odham" in IPA is ['ɔ.θəm]. %0a%0aThe main treaty concerning the land near Phoenix is Cession 689. %0a%0aThe O'odham language is still alive, with indigenous communities all over Arizona speaking it in daily life. There are maybe thirty to forty thousand O'odham people in all of these communities put together. It is difficult to get an exact count of the number of speakers for two reasons. First, it is difficult to ascertain what proportion of the above number speaks the language. Second, the above number has such a wide range because some O'odham communities live on the same reservation as the Piipaash, a separate tribe, and these two populations are counted together. I would estimate that there are about twenty-five to thirty thousand speakers of O'odham today. Revitalization efforts are underway; there are licensed O'odham instructors (the Ak-Chin community was the first to have them), as well as online content such as the YouTube channel Sid in O'odham (whose pronunciation I used for my transcription). %0a%0aWikipedia has more information about the language itself than the indigenous-run sites. It also has more statistics about the language, such as the number of speakers. For example, it provided a link that estimated that there were about 9750 speakers in 2000. Even accounting for population growth and revitalization efforts over the last twenty years, my above estimate seems a bit high. However, Wikipedia indicates that 9750 is likely low due to underreporting, so I feel okay about my estimate. The indigenous-run sites provide more insight into the history and culture surrounding the language. For example, multiple indigenous-run sites make it clear that the word "Huhugam" refers to deceased ancestors of the O'odham people, while most non-indigenous people use the word "Hohokam" to refer to a specific culture that most archeologists believe died out about seven centuries ago. Therefore, sites like Wikipedia tend to give more statistics about the language and examples of the language translation that demonstrate the phonology and syntax. Indigenous-run sites detail the history surrounding the peoples that influenced how the dialects developed, the consequences of revitalization efforts, and examples of language translation that directly relate to indigenous culture. %0a%0aSources: %0aSalt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community: %3chttps://www.srpmic-nsn.gov/>%0aGila River Indian Community: %3chttp://www.gilariver.org/>%0aAk-Chin Indian Community: %3chttps://www.ak-chin.nsn.us/>%0aTohono O'odham Nation: %3chttp://www.tonation-nsn.gov/>%0aInter Tribal Council of Arizona: %3chttps://itcaonline.com>%0aSid in O'odham's channel: %3chttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0xrGPW_d8pQ8SFujXpmAFw>%0aWikipedia--O'odham language: %3chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%25CA%25BCodham_language>%0aWikipedia--Hohokam: %3chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohokam>%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
