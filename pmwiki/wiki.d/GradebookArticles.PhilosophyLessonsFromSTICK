We can make a walking STICK, but we can also make a STICK of dynamite. We say someone is a STICK when he/she is very slim. A threat of punishment or unwelcome measures can be called a STICK, while a quarter-pound pack of butter or margarine is also a STICK. One who's pregnant is up the STICK. We can STICK a fork into the sausage and STICK a piece of paper on the wall. When something is noticeable, it STICKS out. When we can't move something, it is STUCK. Figuratively, when we're unable to progress with a task, we get STUCK. We can STICK to our goals and get STUCK in doing what we love. When we witness shocking incidents, they STICK in our minds for a long time. When it's difficult or impossible to express our feelings, we say the words STICK in one's throat.%0a%0aIn the culture of Nacirema, it seems like they have ambiguous attitudes toward long, straight objects. On one hand, such objects are probably commonplace in the Nacirema society because they are used as quantifiers and used as a unit in measuring butter. Likely, it is upheld as the representation of stability in society, as many definitions of "stick" are associated with immobility. On the other hand, the stick might also symbolize power and force, as it is related to force and criticism in some definitions.%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
