Well, we've established its meaning through our lovey, dovey night on the town (so that's good woo). I think we can all agree that a food being overspiced (or better yet, underspiced) is not as uncommon as the dictionary creators say (so that's our widespread use). And most importantly, we can also most certainly agree that the history of excessive spice has been a phenomenon for not centuries, but millenniums!!! %0a%0aSo that covers it, overspiced should become a word in the Oxford dictionary.

Any use of the word 'overspiced' is simply a grammatical mistake for saying 'overly spiced' and is unlikely to gain widespread WRITTEN use since people are more conscious of grammar when writing/typing than when speaking.

I would argue that this does meet the widespread and sustained use of the word, because whether you're from Pennsylvania or California, it has and will be used in conversation. Despite only small differences, I believe that it IS simpler than "overly spiced". An entire syllable is eliminated when the "-ly" gets removed, making it more efficient for me to write AND use in my daily banter. It has a clear definition as well, as illustrated by jaceyagoda.
