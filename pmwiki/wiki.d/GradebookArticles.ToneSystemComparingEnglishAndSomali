However, languages can use tone while speaking without being a tonal language. Even in standard American English, we sometimes raise our voice at the end of a sentence to indicate that it's a question. However, this upspeak does not change the words' actual meaning. However, in a tonal language like Chinese, the same vowels and consonants can be pronounced with different tone to take on a different meaning. For example, the word "ma" can be pronounced with different tones to mean either "horse", "hemp", "scold", or "mom". %0aSome languages have more tones than others to signify meaning. Some pitch-accent languages only have 2 tones to convey meaning. One interesting fact is that places that are more humid have developed more tonal languages because humid air allows for more movement of vocal cords. %0a%0aIn English, no matter the tone we use when we are speaking, the meaning of the word remains the same. Somali, on the other hand, has a simple tone system. The three basic tones are high, low, and falling. In this language, tone is strongly coupled with stress and it also works on a grammatical level. The vowels and consonants in boy and girl in Somali are the same but the stress and the tone in the two words is what differentiates them. %0a%0aIt would be interesting to study how difficult native English speakers find it to pronounce words in Somali (or other tonal languages). I imagine it would be much more difficult than trying to pronounce words that do not have tonal differences. This also leads me to wonder if non-tonal languages are capable of evolving to take on tonal qualities, or if language is not capable of taking on a whole new feature but only new words. %0a%0aSources:%0ahttps://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/tonal-languages%0ahttps://www.mustgo.com/worldlanguages/somali/#:~:text=The%2520tonal%2520system%2520of%2520Somali,in%2520languages%2520such%2520as%2520Chinese.%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/127%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
