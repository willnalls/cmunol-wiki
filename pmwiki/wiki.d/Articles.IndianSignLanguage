The sign language is more or less standardized throughout the country, although according to Wikipedia each region has its own dialect. The dialects listed include Bangalore-Madras (South), Bombay (West), Kolkata (East), and Delhi (North), among others. The Indian Sign Language also appears to be closely related to Pakistani Sign Language and Nepalese Sign Language.%0a%0aUnfortunately, there are not many opportunities for deaf/mute children in India to learn ISL. The teaching practices for these students tends to be more "oralist," meaning that instead of teaching the sign language, schools tend to teach deaf and mute children how to read lips and understand spoken language that way. ISL also lacks strong government support - according to one government website, there are about 5 million deaf people in the country, but ISL is not officially taught in deaf schools and it has "less than 300 certified interpreters." Additionally, many parents of these children do not know the resources available to help educate their child in ISL. Luckily, there has been an effort in recent years to help "promote and develop sign language and teaching and training of interpreters." This began with the opening of the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Center in New Delhi in 2015.%0a%0aSources:%0ahttp://www.islrtc.nic.in/history-0%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_Sign_Language%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210507-162418-180460#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Developing an ISL Dictionary  %0a-> - roochis%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aRecently, they've approved the development of India's first Sign Language Dictionary.
