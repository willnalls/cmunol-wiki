One stage that babies go through is babbling, in which they attempt to make new sounds that they have just learned, prior to being able to generate any words. However, this stage of development is not unique to spoken languages: it turns out that babies learning to speak ASL go through a similar stage.%0a%0aWhat this babbling actually looks like can be seen in one very cute video [1]. As you can see, the baby is attempting to get used to the rhythm of signs in ASL, but if you are a speaker of ASL, you would know that the baby is not forming any real words. It is interesting to see the baby get adapted to the patterns of sign language, which mirror the prosody of speech, without actually forming words.%0a%0aInvestigating further, I found that just as in spoken languages, there is a pattern to the way in which babies begin to babble in sign language. Initially, babies might sign a sort of grasping, or move their finger horizontally, as these motions are frequently signed at them. In the linked article [2], as the baby progresses, she develops a sort of milking motion and then attempts to mimic the simpler patterns signed at her by her mother. As time goes on, letters and words become easier for her to sign, and then new motions that she has not yet learned are the ones that are babbled.%0a%0aAll in all, I thought that it was pretty interesting to see that acquisition of sign language is similar to acquisition of spoken language, as well as which patterns in sign language are acquired in the early stages.%0a%0a[1] https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/baby-babbles-sign-language-adorable-235809082.html%0a[2] https://www.handspeak.com/kid/index.php?id=37%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_audrey:)
