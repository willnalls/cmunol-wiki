Often times this -ing suffix is shortened to the form -in', ending with a %3cn> sound instead of a %3cŋ>. This can be used with any tense, past, present or future. There doesn't appear to be a signifier as to when a-prefixing can be used and when it can't be, and speakers who use a-prefixing may use it sometimes and not others with no clear reason for use or non-use of either. More Standard English will preclude this prefix and maintain the full -ing without shortening. Speakers who use A-prefixing would say 'He's a-huntin' and a-fishin''whereas a more standard speaker may say 'He's hunting and fishing'.  The Yale Grammatical Diversity Project mentions this phenomena as existing in Appalachia and the Ozarks as well as there being some evidence of it existing in Scotland, Ireland, and England (primarily Southern England). It also mentions this being observed as primarily from white speech communities, but this could be largely due to studies focusing more in that area. In my personal experience with A-prefixing, I know it to exist outside of Appalachia in the Carolinas in Eastern Carolina, particularly in more rural areas. I've also heard it from both southern black and white speakers in the region and had assumed it was a property of Southern dialect. It isn't used for all cases and most often you will see or hear it used in the case of multiple verbs,'A-jumpin' and A-hoppin'' or 'A-huntin' and A-fishin'' being the most common pairs I've heard. Typically it is used when the verbs in question are thought to be related in some sense, or commonly done together. This appears to be different than the example provided in the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project which display more uses of single verbs with A-prefixing, and this could be a property of A-prefixing that is more distinct for Appalachia and the Ozarks. %0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210424-035606-913730#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Examples of A-prefixing in Appalachian English %0a-> - TimG%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThis video contains many examples of Appalachian English features, and although the video mainly focuses on unique vocabulary in Appalachian English, the speakers can also be heard to use many Appalachian English grammatical constructs, including a-prefixing.
