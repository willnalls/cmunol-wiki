It is in the German-based creole language family. As of 2017, there are 100 native speakers in Australia and 10 native speakers in Papua New Guinea. It is considered a lingua franca, or bridge language. It bridged German and Tok Pisin, a native Papua New Guinean language. It uses a German lexicon with Tok Pisin grammar rules. It was the result of German Christian missionary schools in Papua New Guinea. After Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975, most speakers moved to Australia. The EGIDS for this language is given somewhere between 6b-9. From the description of the EGIDS scale, I would place it  between a 7 and 8a. Most speakers are middle-aged or older. Because of increased mobility and intermarriage between communities, the language is not being passed on to new generation.
