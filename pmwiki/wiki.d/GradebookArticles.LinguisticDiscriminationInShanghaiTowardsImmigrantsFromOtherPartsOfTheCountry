However, for some local Shanghainese people, they perceive immigrants as taking away their homeland and taking advantage of their resources. As a result, a lot of them have a somewhat hostile attitude towards immigrants and give them worse treatments than locals. One major way they identify immigrants is by their accents. Due to Shanghainese' unique language features as illustrated in the previous paragraph, it is easy to identify people who don't understand their dialect or don't speak Mandarin with Shanghai accent. %0a%0aFor those who they identify as local Shanghainese or more broadly people from the Yangtze River Delta Region, the locals would greet them with a warmer attitude and show them more patience in customer services. For example, one of my friend recounts that when he spoke Mandarin at a quarantine hotel in Shanghai, the receptionist was slow to respond to his request, but as soon as he switched to speaking Shanghainese, the person changed his attitude and took care of his needs immediately. In contrast, another friend of mine was discriminated in Shanghai's job market due to her Northeastern accent and has to turn to other cities for job opportunities.%0a%0aTo learn more about the issue, you could refer to the following links:%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese#Immigrants%25E2%2580%2599_Opinions_toward_Shanghainese%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a(:GradedBy: TA_lili:)
