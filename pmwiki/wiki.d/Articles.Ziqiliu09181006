Although the majority of the world languages use changes of pitch to convey meanings of emphasis or contrast, it is untypical to use them to change the meanings of words themselves in specific languages.%0a%0aAccording to WALS's data, English uses no tone (for both British and American English), while Mandarin uses a complex tone system. Similarly, PHOIBLE's inventories indicate that English has 0 or 1 tone, while Mandarin has 4. In Mandarin, phonetical symbols such as %3cmā>, %3cmá>, %3cmǎ>, and %3cmà> encode entirely different meanings, although they all sound like %3cma> without their tones. This is because Mandarin does not have a unique correspondence between how a word sounds and what it means, as English does. Instead, Mandarin uses Chinese characters to uniquely encode a morpheme (or a group of morphemes of related meanings). Therefore, tones are introduced as means of differentiating otherwise identically pronounced morphemes. However, they do not entirely prevent pronunciation-meaning conflicts from happening, in which case it is up to the listener to resolve them based on the context of the conversation.  %0a%0aA comment on the last part: The occasional occurrence of such conflicts can be a rich source of tone twisters in Mandarin that involves tricky variations of tones, which is not common in English.

Usually, speech recognition scholars recognize five tone systems in Mandarin Chinese (a “toneless” tone in addition to the four the author lists). To code the toneless and tonal vowel syllables, scholars list all the monophthong and diphthongs. They also build up extra “vowel clusters” as among all the vowels in one Chinese character, only one vowel will have tone (either toneless or tonal).%0a%0aIt is also interesting to draw a contrast between tongue twisters in English and Mandarin Chinese. As the author described, Chinese tongue twisters mostly focus on variation of tones, as well as blade-alveolars (e.g., z, c, s) and retroflexes (e.g., zh, ch, sh), while in English, tongue twisters mainly include the same word-initial consonant (e.g., nine nice night nurses nursing nicely) and vowels in similar height, backness, rounding, or tenseness. This contrast also indicates the different consonant systems between English and Mandarin Chinese.%0a%0aReferences%0a[1] Liao, Y. F. & Tsai, C. H. (2019).
