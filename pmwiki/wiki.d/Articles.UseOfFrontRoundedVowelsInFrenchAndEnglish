Rounded vowels are vowels which are produced with the lips  rounded together forming a circular opening, front rounded vowels are vowels with rounded lips produced at the front of the mouth. There are two category of front rounded vowels in the WALS database, high and mid. These categories have to do with the height at which the vowel sound is produced, where [y] is a high front rounded vowel and [ø] is a mid front rounded vowel. the WALS database categorizes languages as having no front rounded vowels, only high front rounded vowels, only mid front rounded vowels, or having both.%0a%0aFrench is one of the languages that uses both high and mid front rounded vowels, with the full list of front rounded vowels in French being [y] (high), [ø] (mid), and [œ] (mid). Other languages which have front rounded vowels include (but are not limited to), German, Dutch, Turkish, and some Russian and Chinese languages. One thing that stands out is that the Germanic languages have front rounded vowels except for English. Dutch, German, Swedish, Finnish, and Norwegian all have front rounded vowels so it is odd that English would be one of the only German-based languages which is missing this linguistic feature. English does have rounded vowels, but none of them are produced at the front of the mouth. WALS explains that the front rounded vowels tend to appear in languages with larger vowel quality inventory, but English is also categorized by WALS as having a large vowel quality inventory which makes its lack of front rounded vowels even stranger. Odder still is the fact that French is a Romance or Latin-based language, and seems to be one of the only of its language family that DOES have the front rounded vowel linguistic feature. WALS explains this as the back rounded vowels in Latin being moved forward in French so that they are now front rounded, the example given being the rounded vowel in Latin 'tu' becoming the French 'vous'.%0a%0aDoes the additional vowel inventory provided by these front rounded vowels allow for a more complex language, and does this greater degree of complexity make French more efficient or less likely to be misunderstood/misinterpreted?%0a%0aSOURCES:%0ahttps://wals.info/chapter/11%0ahttps://wals.info/feature/11A#2/22.6/152.8%0ahttps://phoible.org/inventories/view/162%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210508-011421-367540#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Vowel Assimilation in American English Learners of French %0a-> - SubhasishM%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aThis study took many American English learners of French at differing experience levels.
