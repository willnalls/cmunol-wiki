For example, a native speaker of a language with a small or average vowel inventory may have difficulty dissecting speech from a language with a large vowel inventory. This effect is also due to the fact that languages do not necessarily share common vowels, leading to a steeper learning curve in pronunciation of new vowels.%0a%0aEnglish has a vowel inventory size of 15, while Russian has a vowel inventory size of 5. The 5 vowels present in Russian (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) are also present in English, presumably allowing native Russian speakers to have little difficulty in understanding these sounds. On the other hand, commonly used vowels in English such as /æ/, /ʌ/, /ɪ/ are not present in Russian. To put this into perspective, words such as “pan”, “pun”, and “pin” contain vowel sounds foreign to Russian speakers.%0a%0aThe limited vowel inventory size in Russian raises some intriguing questions about the effects vowel inventory size has on other features of a language. From a simplified combinatorial perspective, a word in English with 3 vowel sounds has up to 3,375 (15^3) assignments for those vowels while Russian has 125 (5^3) assignments. This raises the question of whether vowel inventory corresponds with the compactness of a language, i.e. does vowel inventory have some significant correlation with word length, sentence length, etc.?%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a#foxbegin 210226-073526-194190#%0a(:div1 class=expansionhead:)%0a!!!Potential Other Criteria for Compactness %0a-> - sathyas%0a(:div1end:) %0a>>messageitem%3c%3c %0aI think vowel inventory has some impact with regards to compactness of a language, however there are many other criteria that can be used to judge compactness. One example is the number of constants sounds there are. Russian in particular has only 6 common vowel sounds, however it also has 34 consonant sounds versus English's 24 consonant sounds. In this way, languages such as Russian can still have an equal amount of breadth in sounds. Another example of a way of adding compactness is the using tones. Japanese only has 5 vowel sounds and 17 consonant sounds which is significantly less than the amount of phonemes in both English and Russian, however it can make up for the lack of sounds by using tones. So to summarize, I think that combining total amount of sounds in addition to tones can be a way of measuring how compact a language is.%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a#foxend 210226-073526-194190#%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a(:section: :)%0a(:Category: TypologyOfPhoneticContrasts:)
