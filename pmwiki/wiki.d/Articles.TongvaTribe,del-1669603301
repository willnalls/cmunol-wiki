The original stewards of the area were the Gabrielino/Tongva Nation. Although there are multiple names, Gabrielino and Tongva, the tribe prefers to call themselves Tongva as that is their self-name (Source 1). IPA Transcription: tongva The “Resolution from City of Los Angeles” and “Constitution - Recognition Letter” is a treaty between the city of Los Angeles and the tribe to recognize the tribe and their constitution (Source 1). There is no information I can find about specific pedagogical resources that are of direct indigenous source on the internet. There is however a reclamation effort by a tribe of another name that is trying to “reclaiming” the Tongva language as their own (Source 3). There are currently zero native speakers, however, there is are revitalization efforts for the language that are part of these “reclaiming” efforts (Source 2). The summary based off of non-Indigenous-run sources would be much more detailed because there are many more non-indigenous people researching this language than there are indigenous people on the internet. In addition, it would be different in the way that there would be information about pedagogy more easily found, more information about reviving the language, such as a revitalization effort by a linguistics professor at UCLA (Source 4). A difference I found was that many of the sources, which includes one from the LA times, refers to the language and the Tongva people as a “forgotten time and place” (Source 5, or one from omniglot.com, which states the language was spoken, even though it mentions revitalization efforts (Source 6). However one thing that is good is the spread of awareness of such reclamation efforts, such as through omniglot.com, which also has teaching of the alphabet. http://gabrielino-tongva.com/ https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/science/a-reclamation-effort-for-the-tongva-language/vp-AAB8nrR http://gabrielenoindians.org/ http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-linguist-gabrieleno-tongva-indians-use-social-media-to-revive-extinct-language https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-col1-tongva-language-native-american-tribe/ https://omniglot.com/writing/tongva.htm%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#contentends]]%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Expansions:%0a[[#expansions]]%0a%0a[[#expansionsend]]%0a%0a----%0a%25red%25 '''Add an expansion:'''%0a%0a(:if [ exists GradebookExpansions.{$Name}-{$Author} || equal {$Author} {$:Author} ] :)%0a%0a(:elseif [ equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:andrewid} '' || equal {Profiles.{$Author}$:section} '' ] :)%0a%0aYou must enter your andrew ID and section before submitting an expansion. %0a%0a(:else:)%0a%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#newexpansion:)%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a----%0a----%0a%0a!!Comments%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:if equal {$Author} {$:Author}:)%0a!!Change article category%0a(:foxform Site.FoxForms#changearticlecategory:)%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a%0a(:Section: :)%0a(:Category: IndigenousLanguagesOfTheAmericas:)%0a(:Title: Tongva Tribe:)
