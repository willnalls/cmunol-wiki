The obfuscated e-mails will now work from headers, footers and sidebars. A [[forms|form]] attribute "formnovalidate" was added to the core and to the "Cancel" button in the edit form. Core [[table of contents]] will now work better with Cookbook:SectionEdit. Cookbook:RecipeCheck was included in the core -- if you have this recipe already installed, you can simply comment it out from your config.php. The code that handles $EnableRCDiffBytes was refactored to also show the bytes changed in the page histories. New upload extensions [[https://developers.google.com/speed/webp | "webp"]] (images) and [[https://www.opus-codec.org/ | "opus"]] (audio) were added. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.122 {*$:Released} (2019-11-19) [[#v22122]]%0aVersion 2.2.121 was released by mistake and contained some experimental code that was meant to be tested first. %0a%0aThis version fixes a bug with ObfuscateLinkIMap() and international characters. New configuration variables $DefaultUnsetPageTextVars, $DefaultEmptyPageTextVars can set default values for page text variables.

The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.119 {*$:Released} (2019-10-03) [[#v22119]]%0aThis version updates the core for PHP 7.4. Required input fields now feature @@required="required"@@ attributes and modern browsers prevent sending the edit or upload form with empty required fields. Attachlist @@ext=@@ and @@names=@@ arguments now accept patterns and negatives like @@ext=jpg,png@@, @@ext=-pdf@@, or @@names=-th*---*.jpg@@. The Redirect function can now have a 3rd argument with the full URL. The scroll position in the edit text area will be remembered on save-and-edit and preview. A bug was fixed with pagelist while preview. The documentation was updated.%0a%0aA number of features currently provided by recipes were added to the core and disabled by default. You can still use the recipes, or you can disable them and enable the core features. The following features were added:%0a* e-mail obfuscation functions based on Cookbook:DeObMail; see instructions to enable%0a* a FixUrl button based on Cookbook:FixURL, see $EnableGuiEditFixUrl%0a* $EnableNotSavedWarning based on Cookbook:NotSavedWarning%0a* $EnableEditAutoText based on Cookbook:EditHelp%0a* $PmTOC, [@(:toc:)@], [@(:notoc:)@], Table of contents/Numbered headings, based on a simplified variant of Cookbook:AutoTOC%0a* $EnableSortable, basic sortable tables%0a* $EnableRCDiffBytes based on Cookbook:DeltaBytesRecentChanges%0a* $EnableSimpleTableRowspan replicating the markup from Cookbook:RowspanInSimpleTables%0a* $WikiPageCSSFmt enables CSS in a wiki page, based on Cookbook:LocalCSS%0a* $EnableHighlight code highlight feature compatible with "highlight.js"%0a* $AddLinkCSS['othergroup'] and $AddLinkCSS['samedomain'] can contain custom CSS classes for in-wiki links to other groups and for URL links to the same site.%0a%0aThe above new features are disabled by default, see the documentation for more information on how to enable them, or test them on pmwiki.org where most of these are enabled. Please report if you notice any problems.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.118 {*$:Released} (2019-08-28) [[#v22118]]%0aThis version integrates the features of the recipe Cookbook:PreviewChanges into the core. If you currently use this recipe, please uninstall it and add to config.php:%0a  $EnablePreviewChanges = 1;%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.117 {*$:Released} (2019-07-28) [[#v22117]]%0aThis version adds handling of "partial content" requests for file downloads. New video file extensions 'm4v' and '3gp' were added. The Upload form now includes a new text field "Uploader" pre-filled with the name of the editor, and a new variable $EnableUploadAuthorRequired was added (defaults to $EnablePostAuthorRequired). The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.116 {*$:Released} (2019-06-19) [[#v22116]]%0aThis version fixes pagelists with case insensitive matches of page (text) variables for international wikis. If your international wiki pagelists rely on case-sensitive variable matches, please see $PageListVarFoldFn. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.115 {*$:Released} (2019-05-13) [[#v22115]]%0aIn this version the responsive skin in large "desktop" mode changes the search form background to transparent, for easier custom styling of the header. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.114 {*$:Released} (2019-04-02) [[#v22114]]%0aThis version adds a skin directive @@%3c!--IncludeTemplate ... -->@@ and the variable $SkinTemplateIncludeLevel. The core variable documentation format identifiers were moved to the definition term element to allow CSS ":target" styling, and the header and link text of the vardoc table can now be translated. Input forms have a new HTML5 element "tel", a new attribute "pattern" and two bugs were fixed with the classnames of the new elements and with the identifiers of "select" lists. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.113 {*$:Released} (2019-03-01) [[#v22113]]%0aThis version adds a new [@(:input button:)@] form element. All form elements can now accept custom data-* attributes, which can be disabled by setting $EnableInputDataAttr to 0. Both additions are meant for easier integration with custom JavaScript functions or some frameworks.%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.112 {*$:Released} (2019-01-09) [[#v22112]]%0aThis version includes a fix for PHP 7.3, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.111 {*$:Released} (2018-12-08) [[#v22111]]%0aThis version updates core .htaccess files to be compatible with both Apache 2.4 and earlier versions, and the variable $DenyHtaccessContent was added with the updated content. In case of difficulties or questions please contact us.%0a%0aA CSS value in the pmwiki-responsive skin was fixed. The [[MarkupExpression(s)]] [@{(ftime )}@] now accepts @@tz=@@ (time zone) and @@locale=@@ (language locale) arguments. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.110 {*$:Released} (2018-11-05) [[#v22110]]%0aThis version prevents a warning with the [@{(substr )}@] markup expression when non-number arguments are typed. A new variable $PageListSortCmpFunction allows custom functions to order page lists. A new variable $MarkupMarkupLevel indicates when the processing happens inside [@(:markup:)@] blocks. %0a%0aThe default style for @@[=[@escaped code@]=]@@ dropped white spaces inconsistently and was fixed. If you rely on the previous behavior please add this to your pub/css/local.css file to revert it:%0a%0a  code.escaped { white-space: nowrap; }%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.109 {*$:Released} (2018-07-09) [[#v22109]]%0aThis version fixes a bug with the Path: InterMap prefix which was broken in 2.2.108. The function pmcrypt() was updated to prevent more strings from causing "invalid hash" warnings in PHP 7. The variable $EnableMarkupDiag was added to help diagnose all markup calls. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.108 {*$:Released} (2018-07-05) [[#v22108]]%0aThis version adds the $PCCFOverrideFunction variable allowing a custom function to override PCCF(). $AuthUserPageFmt can now be an array of page names. The page cache file name can now be customized. Form checkbox labels now have the same tooltip title as the checkbox. Ordered lists with the [@%25reversed%25@] WikiStyle will have descending numbers. Minor fixes to refcount.php, vardoc.php, and pmcrypt(). The default InterMap PmWiki URLs have now the HTTPS protocol. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.107 {*$:Released} (2018-02-02) [[#v22107]]%0aThis version includes more fixes for PHP 7.2 for forms and pagelists. A new variable $MailFunction allows administrators and developers to write replacement functions for the PHP function "mail()". Styles were improved for right-to-left text blocks embedded into left-to-right texts (and vice versa). The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.106 {*$:Released} (2017-12-01) [[#v22106]]%0aThis version has a rewrite of the function PageListSort() to allow it to work with PHP 7.2, and fixes a bug with the backtick (escape) [@`WikiWord@] markup. The helper function pmsetcookie() and the variables $EnableCookieSecure, $EnableCookieHTTPOnly were added to allow easy setting of secure cookies. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.105 {*$:Released} (2017-11-07) [[#v22105]]%0aThis version fixes a bug with the PQA() function causing invalid HTML with attributes glued together. The function @@HandleUpload()@@ was refactored and @@UploadSetVars($pagename)@@ was added to allow upload-managing add-ons to set variables more easily.%0a%0aIf you upgrade from 2.2.98 or earlier, and you have custom markup rules relative to author signatures, please see note about [[#v2299|change in 2.2.99]] (documented November 2017).%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.104 {*$:Released} (2017-10-11) [[#v22104]]%0aThis version fixes a bug with [[WikiTrails#pathtrail|path WikiTrails]] reported today.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.103 {*$:Released} (2017-10-01) [[#v22103]]%0aThis version is a major upgrade on the internal processing of markups and patterns, all core scripts were updated to be compatible with PHP version 7.2. Whether you use that PHP version or another one, with any local configurations and custom add-ons, there should be no change for what you see, but if any problems please contact us immediately.%0a%0aPagelists can now have optimized @@list=grouphomes@@ and @@fmt=#grouphomes@@ arguments to list only the home pages of your wiki groups, whether they are named Group.HomePage, Group.Group, or a custom Group.$DefaultName. Minor bugs in older xlpage scripts were fixed, the responsive skin is now compatible with even older PmWiki/PHP versions, web subtitles (*.vtt) were added as an allowed extension, input form fields can now have a "title" attribute (usually rendered as a tooltip/help balloon when the mouse cursor is over the input element), and a configuration variable $AuthLDAPReferrals was added for wikis running AuthUser over LDAP to force enable or disable referrals when needed.%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.102 {*$:Released} (2017-08-05) [[#v22102]]%0aThis version reverts the patterns for text variables changed in 2.2.99, because we found that a longer text variable content may cause a blank page or an internal server error. In the page [[SiteAdmin.AuthList]] an input box was added to allow filtering of the groups or pages.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.101 {*$:Released} (2017-07-30) [[#v22101]]%0aThis version renames the internal constructor of the PageStore class to be compatible with both PHP 5 and PHP 7. Previously, the PageStore class had two constructors for PHP 4 and PHP 5 compatibility of which one was silently ignored, but recent PHP 7 versions display strict or deprecated notices when the PHP 4 constructor is used.%0a%0aIf you must use PmWiki 2.2.101 or newer on a PHP 4 installation, please contact me so I can provide you with a workaround.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.100 {*$:Released} (2017-07-30) [[#v22100]]%0aThis version provides a workaround for an incompatibility with our Subversion version control system, where the $Author wiki variable was considered a Subversion variable. A fix for the responsive skin adds some spacing above the WikiText block. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.99 {*$:Released} (2017-06-26) [[#v2299]]%0aThis version fixes a bug where an incomplete text variable without a closing parenthesis like "[@(:Var:Value@]" could hide the remaining of the page.%0a%0aA bug was fixed where previewing a page didn't show changes to be done by replace-on-save patterns (the function ReplaceOnSave was refactored). Markup rules for previewing author signatures are no longer needed and were removed. %25note%25 Note that if you had custom markup rules processed before or after the @@[=~~=][=~=]@@ or @@[=~~=][=~~=]@@ author signatures may need to be set to [@'%3c[[~'@] (second argument of the @@Markup@@ call).%0a%0aA bug and a warning for PHP 4 installations were fixed. Two minor bugs with the [@[[%3c%3c]]@] line break for the responsive skin and the $Version variable link in the documentation were fixed. %0a%0aThe InterMap prefix to Wikipedia was corrected to use the secure HTTPS protocol and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.98 (2017-05-31) [[#v2298]]%0aThis version adds a new skin that is better adaptable to both large and small screens, desktop and mobile devices (touchscreens). The new skin "pmwiki-responsive" is not enabled by default but available as an option, and as a base for customized copies. It requires a relatively modern browser (post-2009). The old skin is still available and enabled by default.%0a%0aThe Vardoc links now use MakeLink() to allow a custom LinkPage function. The function ReplaceOnSave() was refactored to allow easier calling from recipes. Markup processing functions now can access besides $pagename, a $markupid variable that contains the "name" of the processed markup rule, allowing a single function to process multiple markup rules. The "*.mkv" video extension was added to the list of allowed uploads.%0a%0aA bug was fixed with the [@(:markup:)@] output where a leading space was lost. Note that the "markup" frame is now wrapped in a %3cpre> block with a "pre-wrap" style instead of %3ccode>.%0a%0aA number of other (minor) bugs were fixed: see ChangeLog, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.97 (2017-04-07) [[#v2297]]%0aThis version fixes a bug concerning $ScriptUrl when $EnablePathInfo is set, introduced in 2.2.96 and reported by 3 users.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.96 (2017-04-05) [[#v2296]]%0aThis version fixes a severe PHP code injection vulnerability, reported by Gabriel Margiani. PmWiki versions 2.2.56 to 2.2.95 are concerned.%0a%0aOnly certain local customizations enable the vulnerability. Your website may be at risk if your local configuration or recipes call too early some core functions like CondAuth(), RetrievePageName() or FmtPageName(), before the $pagename variable is sanitized by ResolvePageName() in stdconfig.php. A specific URL launched by a malicious visitor may trigger the vulnerability.%0a%0aMost recipes call core functions from a $HandleActions function, or from a Markup expression rule, these do not appear to be affected by the current exploit.%0a%0aIf your wiki may be at risk, it is recommended to upgrade to version 2.2.96 or most recent at the earliest opportunity. If you cannot immediately upgrade, you should place the following line in your local (farm)config.php file:%0a%0a  [@$pagename = preg_replace('![${}\'"\\\\]+!', '', $pagename);@]%0a%0aPlace this line near the top of the file but after you include scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php or other character encoding file.%0a%0aThis version filters the $pagename variable to exclude certain characters. A new variable $pagename_unfiltered is added in case a recipe requires the previous behavior. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.95 (2017-02-28) [[#v2295]]%0aThis is a documentation update version.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.94 (2017-01-31) [[#v2294]]%0aThis version allows webmasters to configure and use both .html and .htm extensions. The cached information about whether a page exists or not will now be cleared when that page is created or deleted. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.93 (2016-12-31) [[#v2293]]%0aThis is a documentation update version.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.92 (2016-11-30) [[#v2292]]%0aThis version allows administrators to disable the "nopass" password by setting $AllowPassword to false. The function FmtPageName() will now expand PageVariables with asterisks like [@{*$FullName}@]. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.91 (2016-09-30) [[#v2291]]%0aThis is a documentation update version.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.90 (2016-08-31) [[#v2290]]%0aThis version adds a parameter to the upload form which can improve analytics from the server logs. Two new CSS classes were added to help skin developers: @@imgonly@@ and @@imgcaption@@, for standalone embedded pictures with or without a caption. A bug with the plus-links was fixed. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.89 (2016-07-30) [[#v2289]]%0aThis version allows to set a default class name for simple tables. The [@(:searchbox:)@] directive can now have a "placeholder" attribute, and the input type can be changed from "text" to "search" for HTML5 websites. The edit form elements have now identifier attributes to allow easier styling. All core scripts will now inject CSS into the skin only if it hasn't already been defined. The vardoc.php script now recognizes and links to the documentation for the variables $pagename, $Author and $Skin. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.88 (2016-06-29) [[#v2288]]%0aThis version fixes invalid HTML output of some WikiTrail links. The function PHSC() can now have an optional fourth argument for a safe replacement of htmlspecialchars(). A new page variable [@{$SiteAdminGroup}@] was added and the documentation was updated. %0a%0a!! Version 2.2.87 (2016-05-31) [[#v2287]]%0aThis version adds the $HTMLTagAttr variable to be used in the %3chtml> tag in skins for additional attributes like "lang" or "manifest". To enable it, use it in your skin, for example:%0a%0a  %3chtml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" $HTMLTagAttr>%0a%0aThe variable $EnableRevUserAgent, if set to 1, will cause the User-Agent string from browsers to be stored with each page history entry (as opposed to only storing the last user agent string). The output variable $DiffUserAgent can be used in history templates like $DiffStartFmt.%0a%0aA wrong page variable in [[Site.UploadQuickReference]] was corrected, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.86 (2016-04-28) [[#v2286]]%0aThis version adds updates for PHP 7, for the PageStore() class and for the $DefaultPasswords default/unset definitions (no action should be needed upon upgrades). The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.85 (2016-03-31) [[#v2285]]%0aThis version adds Scalable Vector Graphics (*.svg, *.svgz) as allowed uploads and as embeddable picture extensions (with the html tag %3cimg/>). The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.84 (2016-02-21) [[#v2284]]%0aThis version fixes "indent" and "outdent" styles for right-to-left languages. A new variable $EnableLinkPlusTitlespaced allows "plus links" [@[[Link|+]]@] to display the "Spaced Title" of the page instead the "Title". The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.83 (2015-12-31) [[#v2283]]%0aThis is a documentation update version.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.82 (2015-11-30) [[#v2282]]%0aThis version enables stripmagic() to process arrays recursively and updates the documentation.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.81 (2015-10-31) [[#v2281]]%0aThis version fixes an inconsistency with single line page text variables. International wikis enabling UTF-8 will now be able to use the CSS classes "rtl" and "ltr" to override the text direction when inserting right to left languages. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.80 (2015-09-30) [[#v2280]]%0aThis version modifies the [@(:searchbox:)@] directive to use type="search" semantic input, and updates the documentation.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.79 (2015-08-27) [[#v2279]]%0aThis version adds WikiStyles for the CSS basic colors "fuchsia", "olive", "lime", "teal", "aqua", "orange" and "gray"/"grey". New input elements "email", "url", "number", "date", and "search" can now be used in wiki forms. %0a%0aNote: the "target" attribute of input forms which was added in the previous version broke the PmForm processor, and was removed until we find a solution. If you don't use PmForm and require this attribute (or others), the usual way to add it is to redefine the $InputAttrs array in your local configuration.%0a%0aA new variable $EnableROSEscape can be set to 1 if $ROSPatterns and $ROEPatterns should not process source text wrapped with [@[=...=]@] or @@[=[@...@]=]@@. By default "replace on edit" patterns are performed even in such text.%0a%0aThe insMarkup() function in guiedit.js was refactored to allow custom input ids and/or custom functions to process the selected text.%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.78 (2015-07-21) [[#v2278]]%0aThis version updates the $RobotPattern list with currently active user agents. {-Input forms can have a "target" attribute-} (removed in 2.2.79). The documentation was updated.%0a%0aNote, this release broke the Cookbook:PmForm module. Please do upgrade to 2.2.79 or newer if your wiki uses PmForm.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.77 (2015-06-19) [[#v2277]]%0aThis version extends the [@(:if attachments:)@] conditional to specify file and page names. A [@{$WikiTitle}@] page variable was added. A MatchNames() function was introduced as a generic way to match array values the same way MatchPageNames() does currently with lists of pages -- recipe authors can use it to get a subset of attachments for example. The PageStore() class was slightly optimized when recoding pages from-to UTF-8. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.76 (2015-05-31) [[#v2276]]%0aThis version improves support for arrays in form elements: setting default values and recovering values from posted forms. A new "label" argument to checkbox and radio input elements allows easy insertion of clickable text labels after the form elements. Division blocks wrapping standalone images, and standalone image captions, now receive CSS classes allowing greater control via stylesheets. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.75 (2015-04-26) [[#v2275]]%0aThis version adds a pmcrypt($pass, $salt) function which can be used as a replacement for the PHP crypt() function when encrypting passwords. From PHP 5.6 on, crypt() should not be used without a $salt parameter and would raise a notice. If pmcrypt() is called with a $salt parameter it will simply call crypt() in order to check a password. If it is called without a $salt parameter,  pmcrypt() will create a password hash with the password_hash() function or with crypt() depending on your installation. You can replace any calls to crypt() with pmcrypt(), notably in config.php when defining $DefaultPasswords entries.%0a%0aMarkup was added for the semantic HTML5 tags article, section, nav, header, footer, aside, address.%0a%0aA bug with the uploads feature was fixed when $EnableReadOnly is set, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.74 (2015-03-28) [[#v2274]]%0aThis version allows the translation of the word "OK" in authentication forms. The documentation was updated to the latest state on pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.73 (2015-02-28) [[#v2273]]%0aThis release only updates the documentation to the latest state on pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.72 (2015-01-27) [[#v2272]]%0aThis version improves the ?action=ruleset display for markup rules potentially incompatible with PHP 5.5 when the function debug_backtrace() is not available. It restores the ability to set a custom function handling the [=(:markup:)=] demos. A variable $AbortFunction was added allowing administrators to override the core Abort() function. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.71 (2014-12-29) [[#v2271]]%0aThis version removes the hard word wrap in [@(:markup:)@] wikicode examples, and instead of %3cpre> tags, it wraps it in %3ccode> tags. This allows newcomers to copy and paste the code in their wikis without inserted line breaks (which often cause the markup to not work).%0a%0aThe release also adds back-tracing for markup rules potentially incompatible with PHP 5.5. Such rules, often added by recipes, can trigger "Deprecated: preg_replace()" warnings. To find out which recipes may trigger the warnings, enable diagnostic tools in config.php with @@$EnableDiag = 1;@@ then open a page with the 'ruleset' action, eg. [@[[HomePage?action=ruleset]]@]. The PHP-5.5-incompatible rules will be flagged with filenames, line numbers and patterns. See also the pages [[(PmWiki:)Troubleshooting]] and [[(PmWiki:)CustomMarkup]] on pmwiki.org.%0a%0aThe variable $DraftActionsPattern was added, the pagelist "request" parameter can now contain a list of allowed or disallowed parameters that can be overridden by the user, the "input default source" parameter can now contain multiple pages, and a minor bug was fixed in upload.php ('strict' warning). See the updated documentation for more information. %0a%0a!! Version 2.2.70 (2014-11-08) [[#v2270]]%0aThis release only updates the documentation to the latest state on pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.69 (2014-10-13) [[#v2269]]%0aThis version fixes a bug when dates are defined as relative to other dates, eg. "2014-10-13 -3 days". The documentation was updated; note that the instructions in Site.UploadQuickReference were updated to reflect the display of the upload form in current browsers.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.68 (2014-09-01) [[#v2268]]%0aThis version adds a Skins: InterMap prefix pointing to the Skins section on PmWiki.org, a "signature" markup in the edit quick reference, new WikiStyles clear, min-width and max-width and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.67 (2014-08-02) [[#v2267]]%0aThis version fixes an inconsistency with input forms when values are taken from PageTextVariables. The documentation was updated to the latest state on pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.66 (2014-07-02) [[#v2266]]%0aThis version fixes a minor longstanding bug in the default Notification format when a page is deleted. In custom patterns, the "_" character will no longer be considered a function name. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.65 (2014-06-07) [[#rel2.2.65]]%0aThis version fixes Pagelist handling of [@{$$PseudoVars}@] when they contain page variables. File permissions handling was improved when the current directory is owned by "root". The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.64 (2014-05-08) [[#rel2.2.64]]%0aThis version adds the [="{(mod)}"=] markup expression for modulo/remainder calculations, and the "tel:" and "geo:"  URI schemes which, on compatible devices like smartphones, allow the creation of links to dial telephone numbers and open map/location applications. %0a%0aThe $SysMergePassthru switch was added, if enabled, it allows the "Simultaneous Edits" conflict resolution to use the passthru() function instead of popen().%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.63 (2014-04-05) [[#rel2.2.63]]%0aThis version allows for form elements to have custom attributes containing a dash in the attribute names and enables the attributes 'required', 'placeholder' and 'autocomplete' for HTML5 forms. A minor bug with pagelist [={$$RequestVariables}=] appearing on some installations was fixed. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.62 (2014-02-28) [[#rel2.2.62]]%0aThis version adds the variable $EnableTableAutoValignTop which allows to make advanced tables compatible with HTML5. For developers, a fourth argument $template was added to the Markup_e() function, and a callback template 'return' was added. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.61 (2014-01-31) [[#rel2.2.61]]%0aThis version removes unnecessary snippets of code and adds the variable $TableCellAlignFmt which allows to make simple tables compatible with HTML5. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.60 (2014-01-12) [[#rel2.2.60]]%0aThis version reverts the changes to the pmwiki.css file made in 2.2.59. %0a%0a!! Version 2.2.59 (2014-01-11) [[#rel2.2.59]]%0aThis version has an improvement for Blocklist when multiple text fields are posted. A bug with some nested markup conditionals was fixed. The default skin switched font sizes from points (fixed) to percents (relative). A couple of other minor bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.58 (2013-12-25) [[#rel2.2.58]]%0aThis version enables customization of [=(:input auth_form:)=], and fixes a couple of minor bugs. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.57 (2013-11-03)%0aThis version enables the use of the Attach: link format in the [[PmWiki/PageDirectives#attachlist|[=(:attachlist:)=]]] directive. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.56 (2013-09-30)%0aThis version aims to fix a PHP 5.5 compatibility issue with a deprecated feature of the preg_replace() function. The PageStore() class now detects and works around a bug with the iconv() function, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.55 (2013-09-16)%0aThis version adds the variable $EnableDraftAtomicDiff. If enabled, publishing from a draft version will clear the history of intermediate draft edits, and the published version will contain a single combined diff from the previous published version. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.54 (2013-08-13)%0aThis version fixes a bug when old versions are restored from draft pages. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.53 (2013-07-08)%0aThis version enables a message to be shown when a post is blocked because of too many unapproved links. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.52 (2013-06-08)%0aThis version hides warnings about a deprecated feature in PHP 5.5 installations (preg_replace with /e eval flag). Three new upload extensions were added: docx, pptx and xlsx produced by recent versions of some office suites. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.51 (2013-05-08)%0aThis version updates the addresses for the remote blocklists. A minor XSS vulnerability for open wikis, which was discovered today, was fixed. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.50 (2013-04-08)%0aThis release only updates the documentation to the latest state on pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.49 (2013-03-09)%0aThis version adds an array $UploadBlacklist containing forbidden strings of an uploaded filename (case insensitive). Some Apache installations try to execute a file which has ".php", ".pl" or ".cgi" anywhere in the filename, for example, "test.php.txt" may be executed. To disallow such files to be uploaded via the PmWiki interface, add to config.php such a line:%0a%0a  $UploadBlacklist = array('.php', '.pl', '.cgi', '.py', '.shtm', '.phtm', '.pcgi', '.asp', '.jsp', '.sh');%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.48 (2013-02-11)%0aThis version fixes a bug introduced yesterday with some links. %0a%0a!! Version 2.2.47 (2013-02-10)%0aThis version enables tooltip titles in links to anchors in the same page, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.46 (2013-01-07)%0aThis version adds $UploadPermAdd and $UploadPermSet variables, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0aIf your wiki has uploads enabled, it is recommended to set the variable $UploadPermAdd to 0. %0a%0aThe $UploadPermAdd variable sets additional unix permissions applied to newly uploaded files, and should be 0 (recommended as of 2013). If uploaded files cannot be downloaded and displayed on the website, for example with the error 403 Forbidden, set this value to 0444 (core setting, default since 2004). %0a    $UploadPermAdd = 0; # recommended%0a%0aThe $UploadPermSet variable unconditionally sets the file permissions on newly uploaded files. Only advanced administrators should use it.%0a%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.45 (2012-12-02)%0aThis version fixes some PHP notices appearing on some installations. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.44 (2012-10-21)%0aThis version improves the display of consecutive whitespaces in page histories, and fixes the definition of PageTextVariables containing a dash. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.43 (2012-09-20)%0aThis version makes it possible to use HTML attribute names that contain dashes, and removes a warning when editing and previewing Site.EditForm. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.42 (2012-08-20)%0aThis version provides a workaround for cases when a wiki page contains a character nonexistent in the active encoding. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.41 (2012-08-12)%0aThis version changes the internal $KeepToken separator to be compatible with more encodings. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.40 (2012-07-21)%0aThis version provides a helper function replacing htmlspecialchars() and compatible with PHP 5.4. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.39 (2012-06-25)%0aThis version provides a fix for links to attachments containing international characters. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.38 (2012-05-21)%0aThis version fixes a "parameter count" warning which appeared on some websites.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.37 (2012-05-01)%0aThis version provides a workaround for installations with broken iconv() function, while optimizing the recode function. This should fix the "Unable to retrieve edit form" problem in some wikis. Dots in [[#anchor_1.2]] sections are now better supported, PageVariables are expanded in PageList template defaults, and the documentation is updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.36 (2011-12-28)%0aThis version fixes the recode function to try to recover Windows-1252 characters in ISO-8859-1 files. A new variable $EnableOldCharset enables the $page["=oldcharset"] entry which will be used in the future. A couple of minor bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! [[#v2235]] Version 2.2.35 (2011-11-11)%0aThis release fixes a critical PHP injection vulnerability, reported today by Egidio Romano. PmWiki versions 2.2.X, 2.1.X, 2.0.X and 2.0.beta33 and newer are vulnerable. When you upgrade, please read carefully the Release notes for all PmWiki versions since yours.%0a%0aIf you cannot upgrade, it is recommended to disable Searches at the earliest opportunity (even if your wiki skin doesn't have a search form). Add to config.php such a line:%0a  if ($action == 'search') $action = 'browse';%0a%0aIf your old version wiki allows editing by not entirely trusted visitors, even on limited pages like a WikiSandbox, you should also disable PageLists. Add to config.php this line:%0a  $EnablePageList = 0;%0a%0aThis version has an important change for international wikis: the XLPage() function no longer loads encoding scripts such as xlpage-utf-8.php. When you upgrade, you need to include those scripts from config.php, before calling XLPage():%0a%0a  include_once("scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php"); # if your wiki uses UTF-8%0a  XLPage('bg','PmWikiBg.XLPage');%0a%0aAll links can now have tooltip titles. Previously, only images and external links could have tooltip titles, now this feature is enabled for internal links. To set a tooltip title, add it in quotes after the link address:%0a[@%0a  [[Main.HomePage"This is a tooltip title"]]%0a  [[Main.HomePage"This is a tooltip title"|Home]]%0a  [[http://www.pmwiki.org"Home of PmWiki"]]%0a  Attach:image.jpg"Tooltip title of the image"%0a@]%0a%0aThe following new upload extensions were added: svg, xcf, ogg, flac, ogv, mp4, webm, odg, epub. A couple of minor optimizations were added (MarkupExpressions and rendering of page history) and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.34 (2011-10-10)%0aThis version resets the timestamps of the default pages Site(Admin).AuthUser which are expected in case of upgrades from the versions 2.1.*. Core MarkupExpressions which manipulate strings should now work better with international characters. The documentation was updated to its latest state from pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.33 (2011-09-23) [[#v2233]]%0aThis version fixes a security bug introduced in 2.2.32 which left the groups Site and SiteAdmin open for reading and editing because the pages Site.GroupAttributes and SiteAdmin.GroupAttributes didn't have all necessary attributes. %0a%0aAll wikis running 2.2.32 should upgrade. If you cannot immediately upgrade, you can set the attributes from your wiki:%0a* open the attributes page [=[[SiteAdmin.GroupAttributes?action=attr]]=] and set a "read" and an "edit" password, @@ @lock @@ is recommended.%0a* open the attributes page [=[[Site.GroupAttributes?action=attr]]=] and set an "edit" password, @@ @lock @@ is recommended. Do not set a "read" password here.%0a%0aThe release also fixes the refcount.php script to produce valid HTML, and updates intermap.txt entries PITS: and Wikipedia: to point to their current locations.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.32 (2011-09-18)%0aThis is the first version shipping with the core documentation in the UTF-8 encoding. PmWiki will automatically convert it on the fly for wikis using an older encoding.%0a%0aIt is recommended that all '''new''' PmWiki installations enable UTF-8. Migration of ''existing'' wikis from an older encoding to UTF-8 shouldn't be rushed: it is not trivial and will be documented in the future.%0a%0aA required HTML xmlns attribute was added to the print skin template. The history rendering is now faster when many lines are added or removed.%0a%0a%25note%25 Note: Due to a manipulation error, a version 2.2.31 was created before it was ready for a release.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.30 (2011-08-13)%0aThis version fixes a $Charset definition in international iso-8859-*.php files. This will help for a future transition to UTF-8. %0a%0aA variable $EnableRangeMatchUTF8 was added, set it to 1 to enable range matches of pagenames in UTF-8 like [A-D]. Previously the range matches were always enabled in UTF-8, but we found out that on some installations this feature breaks all pagelists, even those without range matches. In case the feature worked for you, you can re-enable it.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.29 (2011-07-24)%0aThis release fixes Attach links that were broken with the Path fix in 2.2.28 earlier today.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.28 (2011-07-24)%0aThis release fixes 2 potential XSS vulnerabilities and a bug with Path: links.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.27 (2011-06-19)%0aThis release fixes a validation bug on pages after a redirection. A new block WikiStyle [@%25justify%25@] was added, allowing left and right aligned text. The page history now accepts a URL parameter @@?nodiff=1@@ which hides the rendering of edit differences, showing only timestamps, authors, summaries and "Restore" links; it allows to restore a vandalized page with a huge contents or history which otherwise would break the memory or time limits of the server.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.26 (2011-05-21)%0aThis release fixes a redundant removal of link hashes from WikiTrails, and updates the documentation to the most recent version from PmWiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.25 (2011-03-22)%0aThis release only updates the documentation to the latest state on pmwiki.org.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.24 (2011-02-15)%0aThis version reverts the way existing PageVariables are processed, like version 2.2.21 or earlier, but it adds a special variable $authpage which can be used in PageVar definitions. It is the same as the $page array, but exists only if the visitor has read permissions. For example, an administrator can set to config.php:%0a%0a  $FmtPV['$LastModifiedSummary'] = '@$authpage["csum"]'; # instead of '@$page["csum"]'%0a%0aThen, the edit summary metadata will only be available if the user has read permissions.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.23 (2011-01-25)%0aThis version sets the default value of $EnablePageVarAuth to 0 until we investigate a reported problem with authentication.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.22 (2011-01-16)%0aThis version adds the variable $EnableXLPageScriptLoad which, if set to 0, will prevent authors to load scripts from XLPage and to accidentally change the encoding of the wiki. If you use it, make sure you include the required files, eg. xlpage-utf-8.php from local config files.%0a%0aPageVariables should now respect authentications: without read permissions, the title, description, change summary, author of a protected page are unavailable. PageVariables that are computed without reading the page are still available (eg. $Group, $Namespaced, $Version etc.). Administrators can revert the previous behavior by adding to config.php such a line:%0a%0a@@ $EnablePageVarAuth = 0; @@%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.21 (2010-12-14)%0aDue to a mis-configuration of a local svn repository, some of the changes intended for 2.2.20 didn't make it in the correct branch. This release corrects this.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.20 (2010-12-14)%0aThis version fixes a potential XSS vulnerability, reported today. An AuthUser bug with excluding users from authgroups was fixed. A new InterMap prefix PmL10n: was added, it leads to the Localization section on PmWiki.org and should help the work of translators. A couple of other minor bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.19 (2010-11-10)%0aThis is a documentation-update release.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.18 (2010-09-04)%0aThis version fixes 3 minor bugs, and updates the documentation.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.17 (2010-06-20)%0aThis version adds a variable $PostConfig containing functions and scripts to be loaded after stdconfig.php. Tabindex was added as a valid form field attribute. Protected downloads now respect existing browser caches. AuthUser now allows more flexible cookbook recipe integration. A couple of bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.16 (2010-05-10)%0aThis version fixes a bug with parsing html attributes which could allow XSS injection. Wikis allowing unprotected editing are encouraged to upgrade.%0a%0aA bug with the "center" button of the GUI edit toolbar was corrected.%0a%0aThe "exists" conditional now accepts wildcards, for example:%0a  [@(:if exists Main.*:)There are pages in the Main group (:if:)@]%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.15 (2010-03-27)%0aThis version adds some minor bugfixes and optimizations notably a bug with @@[=(:template none:)=]@@ introduced in the last version 2.2.14.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.14 (2010-02-27)%0aThis release corrects inline styles for WikiTrail links. Undefined include/template @@ [={$$variables}=] @@ are now removed from the included section, like Page(Text)Variables, and can be used in conditional expressions. If needed, this change can be reverted by adding to config.php such a line:%0a%0a[@%0a  $EnableUndefinedTemplateVars = 1; # keep and display unset {$$variables}%0a@]%0a%0aPageList templates now accept the sections @@ !first @@ and @@ !last @@ for markup to appear for every page in list ''except'' the first or last one.%0a%0a"Title" attributes were added to external links. You can have tooltip titles on external links, including InterMap and attachments, by adding the link title in double quotes after the URL:%0a  [=[[http://www.pmwiki.org"Home of PmWiki"| External link]]=]%0a%0aFor international wikis, PmWiki now automatically translates the titles of technical pages like GroupAttributes or RecentChanges -- just define these strings as usual in XLPage, for example, in French:%0a  'AllRecentChanges' => 'Tous les changements récents',%0a%0aSome minor optimizations were done and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.13 (2010-02-21)%0aThis release fixes a bug with $DiffKeepNum introduced in 2.2.10 -- the count of revisions was incorrect and a page could drop more revisions than it should.%0a%0aThe [[page history]] layout was modified with a rough consensus in the community. The history now defaults to "source" view with word-level highlighting of the differences. Authors can see the changes in rendered output by clicking on the link "Show changes to output". Admins can switch back the default by adding such a line to config.php:%0a%0a  $DiffShow['source'] = (@$_REQUEST['source']=='y')?'y':'n';%0a%0aTo disable word-level highlighting and show plain text changes:%0a%0a  $EnableDiffInline = 0;%0a%0aIn the page history rendering, a few minor bugs were fixed and the code was slightly optimized.%0a%0aThe documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.12 (2010-02-17)%0aThis release adds simple word-level highlighting of differences in the page history, when "Show changes to markup" is selected. To enable the feature, add to config.php such a line:%0a  $EnableDiffInline = 1;%0a%0aThis feature is like what the InlineDiff recipe provides, but not exactly the same, and the implementation is simpler. It is enabled on PmWiki.org and can be improved -- your comments are welcome.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.11 (2010-02-14)%0aThis release adds two new table directives for header cells, [=(:head:) and (:headnr:)=]. They work the same way as [=(:cell:) and (:cellnr:)=] except that create %3cth> instead of %3ctd> html tags.%0a%0aThe pagerev.php script was refactored into separate functions to allow easier integration of recipes displaying the page history.%0a%0aA couple of minor bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.9, 2.2.10 (2010-01-17)%0aMost important in this release is the official change of $EnableRelativePageVars to 1. The change is about how [={$Variable}=] in included pages is understood by PmWiki.%0a* When $EnableRelativePageVars is set to 0, [={$Name}=] displays the name of the currently browsed page. Even if [={$Name}=] is in an included page, it will display the name of the browsed page.%0a* When $EnableRelativePageVars is set to 1, [={$Name}=] displays the name of the physical page where it written. If [={$Name}=] is in an included page, it will display the name of the included page.%0a* [={*$Name}=] always displays the name of the currently browsed page, regardless of $EnableRelativePageVars.%0a%0aSo, if your wiki relies on page variables from included pages, and doesn't have $EnableRelativePageVars set to 1, after upgrading to 2.2.9, you can revert to the previous behavior by adding to config.php such a line:%0a  $EnableRelativePageVars = 0;%0a%0aMore information about page variables can be found at:%0a  http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/PageVariables%0a%0aThis release adds a new variable $EnablePageTitlePriority which defines how to treat multiple [=(:title..:)=] directives. If set to 1, the first title directive will be used, and if a page defines a title, directives from included pages cannot override it. PmWiki default is 0, for years, the last title directive was used (it could come from an included page or GroupFooter).%0a%0aThis release also adds a new variable $DiffKeepNum, specifying the minimum number (default 20) of edits that will be kept even if some of them are older than the limit of $DiffKeepDays.%0a%0aA number of bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.8 (2009-12-07)%0aThis release fixes another PHP 5.3 compatibility issue with conditional markup. The Author field now handles apostrophes correctly. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.7 (2009-11-08)%0aThis release fixes most PHP 5.3 compatibility issues. Unfortunately some specific builds for Windows may still have problems, which are unrelated to PmWiki. Notably, on Windows, all passwords need to be 4 characters or longer.%0a%0aUpload names with spaces are now correctly quoted. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.6 (2009-10-04)%0aWith this release it is now possible to display recently uploaded files to the RecentChanges pages -- if you have been using the RecentUploadsLog recipe, please uninstall it and follow the instructions at http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/RecentUploadsLog.%0a%0aThe release also introduces $MakeUploadNamePatterns to allow custom filename normalization for attachements. It is now possible to replace $PageListFilters and $FPLTemplateFunctions with custom functions. Notify should now work in safe_mode. Some bugs were fixed, among which one with conditional markup with dates. The documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.5 (2009-08-25)%0aThis release adds a new markup for Pagelist templates, [@(:template none:)@] which allows a message to be set when the search found no pages. The FPLTemplate() function was broken into configurable sub-parts to allow development hooks. A number of bugs were fixed, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.4 (2009-07-16)%0aThis release fixes a bug introduced earlier today with HTML entities in XLPages.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.3 (2009-07-16)%0aThis release fixes six potential XSS vulnerabilities, reported by Michael Engelke. The vulnerabilities may affect wikis open for editing and may allow the injection of external JavaScripts in their pages. Public open wikis should upgrade.%0a%0aA new variable $EnableUploadGroupAuth was added; if set to 1, it allows password-protected [[uploads]] to be checked against the Group password. %0a%0aIt is now possible to use @@ @_site_edit, @_site_read, @_site_admin@@ or @@ @_site_upload @@ global [[passwords]] in GroupAttributes pages.%0a%0aA number of other small bugs were fixed, and the documentation was updated.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.2 (2009-06-21)%0aThe major news in this release is a fix of an AuthUser vulnerability.%0a%0aThe vulnerability affects only wikis that (1) rely on the AuthUser core module %0afor User:Password authentication, -AND- (2) where the PHP installation runs %0awith the variable "magic_quotes_gpc" disabled.%0a%0aAll PmWiki 2.1.x versions from pmwiki-2.1.beta6 on, all 2.2.betaX, 2.2.0, and %0a2.2.1 are affected.%0a%0aThe PmWiki [[SiteAnalyzer]] can detect if your wiki needs to upgrade:%0a  http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/SiteAnalyzer%0a%0aIf your wiki is vulnerable, you should do one of the following at the earliest %0aopportunity:%0a%0a* Upgrade to a version of PmWiki at least 2.2.2 or greater.%0a* Turn on magic_quotes_gpc in the php.ini file or in a .htaccess file.%0a%0aAlternatively, you can temporarily disable AuthUser until you upgrade.%0a%0aNote that even if your wiki does not have the AuthUser vulnerability at the %0amoment, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PmWiki version 2.2.2 or %0alater, as some future configuration of your hosting server might put you at %0arisk.%0a%0aThis release also comes with minor updates in the local documentation; fixes %0awere applied for international wikis - notably global variables in %0axlpage-utf-8.php and a new variable $EnableNotifySubjectEncode, which allows %0ae-mail clients to correctly display the Subject header; and a number of other %0asmall bugs were fixed.%0a%0a!! Version 2.2.1 (2009-03-28)%0aThis release comes with an updated local documentation; [[wiki trails]] now work cross-group; guiedit.php now produces valid HTML, and other small bugs were fixed.  We also added $EnableRedirectQuiet, which allows redirects to take place without any mention of "redirected from page ....".%0a%0a[[#v220]]%0a!! Version 2.2.0 (2009-01-18)%0a%0aThis is a summary of changes from 2.1.x to 2.2.0.%0a%0a* Several pages that were formerly in the [[Site]].* group are now in a separate [[SiteAdmin]].* group, which is read-restricted by default.  The affected pages include Site.AuthUser, Site.AuthList, Site.NotifyList, Site.Blocklist, and Site.ApprovedUrls .  If upgrading from an earlier version of PmWiki, PmWiki will prompt to automatically copy these pages to their new location if needed.  If a site wishes to continue using the old Site.* group for these pages, simply set%0a%0a-> $SiteAdminGroup = $SiteGroup;%0a%0a-> when carrying out this upgrade inspect your config files for lines such as%0a--> $BlocklistDownload['Site.Blocklist-PmWiki'] = array('format' => 'pmwiki');%0a->as you may wish to fix then, eg%0a--> $BlocklistDownload[$SiteAdminGroup . '.Blocklist-PmWiki'] = array('format' => 'pmwiki');%0a%0a* Important Change in Passwords in PmWiki 2.2 indicating that the group can be edited even if a site password is set will be done by @@"@nopass"@@ prior it was done by @@"nopass"@@%0a-> When migrating a wiki you will have to manually modify the permission or by a script replace in all the page concerned @@passwdread=nopass:@@ by @@passwdread=@nopass@@ (see PITS:00961) --isidor%0a%0a* PmWiki now ships with WikiWords entirely disabled by default.  To re-enable them, set either $LinkWikiWords or $EnableWikiWords to 1.  To get the 2.1 behavior where WikiWords are spaced and parsed but don't form links, use the following:%0a-> $EnableWikiWords = 1;%0a-> $LinkWikiWords = 0;%0a%0a* It's now easy to disable the rule that causes lines with leading spaces to be treated as preformatted text -- simply set $EnableWSPre=0; to disable this rule.%0a%0a--> '''Important:''' There is ongoing discussion that the leading whitespace rule may be disabled ''by default'' in a future versions of PmWiki.  If you want to make sure that the rule will continue to work in future upgrades, set $EnableWSPre=1; in ''local/config.php''.%0a%0a* The $ROSPatterns variable has changed somewhat -- replacement strings are no longer automatically passed through FmtPageName() prior to substitution (i.e., it must now be done explicitly).%0a%0a* Page variables and page links inside of [@(:include:)@] pages are now treated as relative to the included page, instead of the currently browsed page.  In short, the idea is that links and page variables should be evaluated with respect to the page in which they are written, as opposed to the page in which they appear.  This seems to be more in line with what authors expect.  There are a number of important ramifications of this change:%0a%0a[[#relativeurls]]%0a** We now have a new [@{*$var}@] form of page variable, which always refers to "the currently displayed page".  Pages such as Site.PageActions and Site.EditForm that are designed to work on "the currently browsed page" should generally switch to using [@{*$FullName}@] instead of [@{$FullName}@].%0a%0a** The $EnableRelativePageLinks and $EnableRelativePageVars settings control the treatment of links and page variables in included pages.  However, to minimize disruption to existing sites, $EnableRelativePageVars defaults to '''disabled'''.  This will give existing sites an opportunity to convert any absolute [@{$var}@] references to be [@{*$var}@] instead.%0a%0a** Eventually $EnableRelativePageVars will be enabled by default, so we highly recommend setting [@$EnableRelativePageVars = 1;@] in ''local/config.php'' to see how a site will react to the new interpretation.  Administrators should especially check any customized versions of the following:%0a---> [[Site.PageActions]]%0a---> [[Site.EditForm]]%0a---> [[Site.PageNotFound]]%0a---> SideBar pages with ?action= links for the current page%0a---> $GroupHeaderFmt, $GroupFooterFmt%0a---> [[Page lists]] that refer to the current group or page, etc in sidebars, headers, and footers%0a%0a** The [@(:include:)@] directive now has a [@basepage=@] option whereby an author can explicitly specify the page upon which relative links and page variables should be based.  If no basepage= option is specified, the included page is assumed to be the base.%0a%0a* Sites that want to retain the pre-2.2 behavior of [@(:include:)@] and other items can set [@$Transition['version'] = 2001900;@] to automatically retain the 2.1.x defaults.%0a%0a* Text inserted via [@(:include:)@] can contain "immediate substitutions" of the form [@{$$option}@] -- these are substituted with the value of any options provided to the include directive.%0a%0a* PmWiki now recognizes when it is being accessed via "https:" and switches its internal links appropriately.  This can be overridden by explicitly setting $ScriptUrl and $PubDirUrl.%0a%0a* A new $EnableLinkPageRelative option allows PmWiki to generate relative urls for page links instead of absolute urls.%0a%0a* Draft handling capabilities have been greatly improved.  When $EnableDrafts is set, then the "Save" button is relabeled to "Publish" and a "Save draft" button appears.  In addition, an $EnablePublishAttr configuration variable adds a new "publish" authorization level to distinguish editing from publishing.  See [[PmWiki:Drafts]] for more details.%0a%0a[[#ptvstart]]%0a* There is a new [@{$:var}@] "page text variable" available that is able to grab text excerpts out of markup content.  For example, [@{SomePage$:Xyz}@] will be replaced by a definition of "Xyz" in SomePage.  Page text variables can be defined using definition markup, a line beginning with the variable name and a colon, or a special directive form (that doesn't display anything on output):%0a%0a-->[@%0a:Xyz: some value            # definition list form%0aXyz: some value             # colon form%0a(:Xyz: some value:)         # directive form%0a@]%0a[[#ptvend]]%0a%0a* The [@(:pagelist:)@] command can now filter pages based on the contents of page variables and/or page text variables.  For example, the following directive displays only those pages that have an "Xyz" page text variable with "some value":%0a%0a-->[@(:pagelist $:Xyz="some value":)@]%0a%0a  Wildcards also work here, thus the following pagelist command lists pages where the page's title starts with the letter "a":%0a%0a-->[@(:pagelist $Title=A* :)@]%0a%0a* The if= option to [@(:pagelist)@] can be used to filter pages based on conditional markup:%0a%0a-->[@(:pagelist if="auth upload {=$FullName}":)@]  pages with upload permission%0a-->[@(:pagelist if="date today.. {=$Name}":)@] pages with names that are dates later than today%0a%0a* Spaces no longer separate wildcard patterns -- use commas.  (Most people have been doing this already.)%0a%0a* Because page variables are now "relative", the [@{$PageCount}, {$GroupCount}, {$GroupPageCount}@] variables used in pagelist templates are now [@{$$PageCount}, {$$GroupCount}, {$$GroupPageCount}@].%0a%0a* One can now use [@{$$option}@] in a pagelist template to obtain the value of any 'option=' provided to the [@(:pagelist:)@] command.%0a%0a* The [@(:pagelist:)@] directive no longer accepts parameters from urls or forms by default.  In order to have it accept such parameters (which was the default in 2.1 and earlier), add a [@request=1@] option to the [@(:pagelist:)@] directive.%0a%0a* The [@count=@] option to pagelists now accepts negative values to count from the end of the list.  Thus [@count=5@] returns the the first five pages in the list, and [@count=-5@] returns the last five pages in the list.  In addition, ranges of pages may be specified, as in [@count=10..19@] or [@count=-10..-5@].%0a%0a* Pagelist templates may have special [@(:template first ...:)@] and [@(:template last ...:)@] sections to specify output for the first or last page in the list or a group.  There's also a [@(:template defaults ...:)@] to allow a template to specify default options.%0a%0a* PmWiki comes with an ability to cache the results of certain [@(:pagelist:)@] directives, to speed up processing on subsequent visits to the page.  To enable this feature, set $PageListCacheDir to the name of a writable directory (e.g., ''work.d/'').%0a%0a* [[#elseifelse]]The [@(:if ...:)@] conditional markup now also understands [@(:elseif ...:)@] and [@(:else:)@].  In addition, markup can nest conditionals by placing digits after if/elseif/else, as in [@(:if1 ...)@], [@(:elseif1 ...:)@], [@(:else1:)@], etc.%0a%0a* The [@(:if date ...:)@] conditional markup can now perform date comparisons for dates other than the current date and time.%0a%0a* [[WikiTrails]] can now specify #anchor identifiers to use only sections of pages as a trail.%0a%0a* A new [@(:if ontrail ...:)@] condition allows testing if a page is listed on a trail.%0a%0a* The extensions .odt, .ods, and .odp (from OpenOffice.org) are now recognized as valid attachment types by default.%0a%0a* A new [[blocklist]] capability has been added to the core distribution.  It allows blocking of posts based on IP address, phrase, or regular expression, and can also make use of publicly available standard blocklists.  See [[PmWiki.Blocklist]] for details.%0a%0a* There is a new [[SiteAdmin.AuthList]] page that can display a summary of all password and permissions settings for pages on a site.  This page is restricted to administrators by default.%0a%0a* There are new [@{$PasswdRead}@], [@{$PasswdEdit}@], etc. variables that display the current password settings for a page (assuming the browser has attr permissions or whatever permissions are set in $PasswdVarAuth).%0a%0a* Forms creation via the [@(:input:)@] markup has been internally refactored somewhat (and may still undergo some changes prior to 2.2.0 release).  The new [@(:input select ...:)@] markup can be used to create select boxes, and [@(:input default ...:)@] can be used to set default control values, including for radio buttons and checkboxes.%0a%0a* The [@(:input textarea:)@] markup now can take values from other sources, including page text variables from other pages.%0a%0a* Specifying [@focus=1@] on an [@(:input:)@] control causes that control to receive the input focus when a page is loaded.  If a page has multiple controls requesting the focus, then the first control with the lowest value of [@focus=@] "wins".%0a%0a* PmWiki now provides a ''scripts/creole.php'' module to enable Creole standard markup.  To enable this, add [@include_once('scripts/creole.php')@] to a local customization file.%0a%0a* PmWiki adds a new [@{(...)}@] ''markup expression'' capability, which allows various simple string and data processing (e.g., formatting of dates and times).  This is extensible so that recipe authors and system administrators can easily add custom expression operators.%0a%0a* It's now possible to configure PmWiki to automatically create Category pages whenever a page is saved with category links and the corresponding category doesn't already exist.  Pages are created only if the author has appropriate write permissions into the group.  To enable this behavior, add the following to ''local/config.php'':%0a%0a-->[@$AutoCreate['/^Category\\./'] = array('ctime' => $Now);@]%0a%0a* Sites with wikiwords enabled can now set $WikiWordCount['WikiWord'] to -1 to indicate that 'WikiWord' should not be spaced according to $SpaceWikiWords.%0a%0a* WikiWords that follow # or & are no longer treated as WikiWords.%0a%0a* Links to non-existent group home pages (e.g., [@[[Group.]]@] and [@[[Group/]]@]) will now go to the first valid entry of $PagePathFmt, instead of being hardcoded to "Group.Group".  For example, to set PmWiki to default group home pages to [@$DefaultName@], use%0a%0a-->[@$PagePathFmt = array('{$Group}.$1', '$1.{$DefaultName}', '$1.$1');@]%0a%0a* PmWiki now provides a $CurrentTimeISO and $TimeISOFmt variables, for specifying dates in ISO format.%0a%0a* [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]] authors can use the internal PmWiki function UpdatePage (temporarily documented at [[(Cookbook:)DebuggingForCookbookAuthors]]) to change page text while preserving history/diff information, updating page revision numbers, updating RecentChanges pages, sending email notifications, etc.%0a%0a* [[Skin templates]] are now required to have %3c!--HTMLHeader--> and %3c!--HTMLFooter--> directives.  Setting $EnableSkinDiag causes PmWiki to return an error if this isn't the case for a loaded skin.  Skins that explicitly do not want HTMLHeader or HTMLFooter sections can use %3c!--NoHTMLHeader--> and %3c!--NoHTMLFooter--> to suppress the warning.%0a%0a* Added a new "pre" wikistyle for preformatted text blocks.%0a%0a* The xlpage-utf-8.php script now understands how to space UTF-8 wikiwords.  %0a%0a* Searches on utf-8 site are now case-insensitive for utf-8 characters.%0a%0a* Many Abort() calls now provide a link to pages on pmwiki.org that can explain the problem in more detail and provide troubleshooting assistance.%0a%0a* PmWiki no longer reports "?cannot acquire lockfile" if the visitor is simply browsing pages or performing other read-only actions.%0a%0a* The $EnableReadOnly configuration variable can be set to signal PmWiki that it is to run in "read-only" mode (e.g., for distribution on read-only media).  Attempts to perform actions that write to the disk are either ignored or raise an error via Abort().%0a%0a* Including authuser.php no longer automatically calls ResolvePageName().%0a%0a* Authentication using Active Directory is now simplified.  In Site.AuthUser or the $AuthUser variable, set "ldap://name.of.ad.server/" with no additional path information (see PmWiki.AuthUser for more details).%0a%0a* Pages are now saved with a "charset=" attribute to identify the character set in effect when the page was saved.%0a%0a* The phpdiff.php algorithm has been optimized to be smarter about finding smaller diffs.%0a%0a* Removed the (deprecated) "#wikileft h1" and "#wikileft h5" styles from the pmwiki default skin.%0a%0a* The mailposts.php and compat1x.php scripts have been removed from the distribution.%0a%0a----%0aBugs and other requests can be reported to the PmWiki Issue Tracking %0aSystem at http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PITS/PITS.  Any help%0ain testing, development, and/or documentation is greatly appreciated..%0a%0a[[(PmWiki:)Release Notes archive]] - notes for versions older than 2.2.0.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a
