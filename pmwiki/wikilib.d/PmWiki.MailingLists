text=(:Summary:The email discussion lists available and their archives:)(:keywords email lists:)%0aThere are several mailing lists available for [[PmWiki]].%0a %0a:[ [[(http://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/)pmwiki-users]] ]: This is a great resource where a very helpful group of people will answer questions and discuss PmWiki development. As of 2022, traffic is around 20-40 messages a month. %0a->''If you ask a question on the list and it doesn't get answered, don't feel let down. Just'' '''''ask it again'''''. It probably slipped by unnoticed.%0a%0a->Archives are available from:%0a-->https://www.pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users/ ([[https://www.pmwiki.org/search-ml.php|searchable here]])%0a-->https://www.mail-archive.com/pmwiki-users@pmichaud.com/info.html (searchable)%0a%0a%0a-->(:input form action='https://www.pmwiki.org/search-ml.php' method='get':)(:input text q:) (:input submit value='Search pmwiki-users archives':)(:input end:)%0a%0a:[ [[(https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/)pmwiki-users-de]] ]: A mailing list for german-speaking users of PmWiki.  Archived at%0a-->https://www.pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users-de%0a%0a:[ [[(https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/)pmwiki-users-es]] ]: Lista de usuarios PmWiki en EspaÃ±ol.%0a%0a:[ [[(https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/)pmwiki-users-fr]] ]: A mailing list for french-speaking users of PmWiki.%0a%0a:[ [[(https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/)pmwiki-devel]] ]: This list was created to lower the traffic on pmwiki-users, it focuses on discussions surrounding code development for PmWiki (both core and recipe development).%0a%0a->Archives are available from:%0a-->https://www.pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-devel/ ([[https://www.pmwiki.org/search-ml.php|searchable]])%0a-->https://groups.google.com/group/pmwiki-devel  (searchable)%0a-->https://www.mail-archive.com/pmwiki-devel@pmichaud.com/info.html (searchable)%0a%0a:[ [[(https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/)pmwiki-announce]] ]: Announcements of new version releases and urgent information, about 1-2 messages per month. If you use PmWiki in a production environment, this low-volume list is highly recommended. The archive is at:%0a-->https://www.pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-announce%0a%0aSuggestions:%0a* If you reply to a digest message, please remove the messages irrelevant to your reply before sending it back to the list.  %0a** It's also helpful to change "@@Re: pmwiki-users Digest, Vol [...]" to "Re: [the original subject]@@" because some mail programs determine threads based on the subject.%0a* If you address a reply to a single list member, please take the [pmwiki-users] off the subject line, or it's possible for your message to get lost in the mailing list traffic. Many people filter list traffic to a separate mailbox.%0a* If you ask a question, you should disable "digest" mode, this way you'll receive the replies as soon as people post them, and you could follow-up. In digest mode you might receive the replies a week or two later.%0a%0a!! Changing mail list settings%0a%0aHere are some tips regarding changing the mailing list settings:%0a%0a* Logging in...%0a** First go to [[https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/listinfo/pmwiki-users]]%0a   and enter your e-mail address in the field at the bottom of the page,%0a   to the left of the button ''Unsubscribe or edit options''.%0a** Next you need to enter your password. As you've probably forgotten this,%0a   use the button ''Remind'' at the bottom of the page to get a new password.%0a** Finally enter the password you should get momentarily via e-mail.%0a%0a* You can directly go to the options web page through a URI such as the%0a  following:%0a-> %25hlt html%25[@https://www.pmichaud.com/mailman/options/pmwiki-users/%3cuser>%2540%3cdomain>@]%0a-> where [@%3cuser>@] is everything before the [@@@] in an e-mail address,%0a   and [@%3cdomain>@] is everything after.%0a   (For those who wonder, the [@%2540@] in the URI just stands for '[@@@]').%0a%0a* You can also obtain various help by sending an email to%0a  @@mailto:pmwiki-users-request@pmichaud.com@@ with the text [@help@] in either%0a  the subject or the body.%0a%0a!! Newsgroups (NNTP)%0aYou may be interested, that the lists are also accessible as newsgroups.%0a%0aThe NNTP server is:%0a* [[news.gmane.io -> https://news.gmane.io/]]%0a%0aThe [[pmwiki groups -> https://admin.gmane.io/]] are:%0a* gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.user%0a* gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.announce%0a* gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.user.de%0a* gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.user.es %0a* gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.user.fr %0a* gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.devel%0a%0a!!! Gmane%0aIf you find a dead link to the PmWiki user groups at Gmane, it is now%0apossible to look for the reference, at https://www.pmwiki.org/search-ml.php and find your%0aanswers and/or update the documentation.%0a%0aYou may have to use the [[WayBack machine -> https://web.archive.org/]] to search by the original URL.%0a%0aThis is a basic and quite fast search function for messages in the [pmwiki-users] and [pmwiki-devel] mailing lists.%0a%0aGmane was a searchable mailing list archive that we used extensively to%0afind information or older discussions, and we also linked to it a lot%0aboth in the documentation and in our everyday messages. It disappeared%0ain 2016 and was only partially restored, so most of the links to it do%0anot work anymore.%0a%0a%0a%0a
